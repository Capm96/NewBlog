    <article  id="articleContent" class="post-content" style="position:relative;">
        <p>When I was little, my mother would tell me &ldquo;eat your vegetables!&rdquo; all the time. Most of the time I did not want to eat the vegetables. But she would tell me &ldquo;it is for your own good&rdquo;, and I believed her. <strong>I believed her.</strong></p>
<p>What did I know? I had no idea about the chemical effects of eating good food. I could not explain how this affected my health, but I trusted my mom, so I complied.</p>
<p>This is an example of a belief – or, &ldquo;accepting that something is true or that it exists&rdquo;. Beliefs are something very, very fundamental to us humans. In my case, my belief was well-meaning. But, I was still guilty of not doing one extremely important thing: asking why or how eating the vegetables is going to help me.</p>
<p>I cannot stress this enough. <strong>It is essential that we always, no matter what, ask &ldquo;why?&rdquo; or &ldquo;how?&rdquo; when someone tells us to believe something.</strong></p>
<p>This is because beliefs can be harmless, but they can also be extremely dangerous. There is an entire spectrum of potential consequences, and it is our responsibility to consider them. History is a book written by the pen of beliefs, and there is no shortage of ink to highlight their power.</p>
<p>There is another belief which falls somewhere in the more harmless side of the spectrum, but which constitutes a meaningful part in modern life: astrology.</p>
<p>There is a vast number of people who believe in astrology. Gallop Polls suggest that around one in four American, Canadian, or British people believe in astrology. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This equates to millions of people around the world. Not to mention populous countries which take astrology quite seriously, as in India.</p>
<p>But, if astrology is under the more harmless side, what is the problem in believing in it?</p>
<p>Different people will give varying answers, but to me, there are three key reasons:</p>
<p>Firstly, accepting that something is true just because someone told you so without thinking critically about it is a habit of doom. What eating vegetables, astrology, and the Witch Hunts all had in common is the captivation through belief.</p>
<p>We should not accept a belief just because it is harmless today. One simple belief today might lead to another one tomorrow, and soon enough a veil of darkness and lack of reason cover reality. I will leave to the likes of Solzhenitsyn and Orwell to explain how that happens.</p>
<p>Secondly, even though astrology concerns itself with something incredibly interesting (space), it cheapens it. It reduces the beautiful complexity of the cosmos to patterns, to alignments, to things which we can understand and chart. It robs people of the true nature of the universe, of the history of planets, stars, galaxies, and of what lies ahead. It hides from us the unbelievable scales of cosmos and the overwhelming feeling of humbleness that comes from looking at the night sky. I find this to be without a doubt, absolutely, lackluster.</p>
<p>Lastly, some people are shaping their decisions around astrological claims. While not harmful and deeply personal, these decisions are not a threat – yet, they might steer you in an entirely new direction, and based on what? From finding a potential match for a partner, to the meetings in the Reagan administration, astrologically based decisions can be taken seriously. Before we choose to base our lives on that, we should consider the reasons behind such extraordinary claims.</p>
<h3 id="the-foundations-of-astrology">The foundations of astrology</h3>
<p>The goal of astrology is to understand how our lives are influenced by hidden forces in the universe. We can understand these hidden forces through the patterns of planets <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and we use these patterns to help us in making day to day decisions. &ldquo;As above, so below&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Depending on the time which you were born, you will possess different personality attributes based on the position of the planets at that given time. Note, however, that it is not so much that the planets exert a direct force upon you, it is the alignment and configuration of the planets are the representation of the underlying forces of the universe, which do affect your life.</p>
<p>For instance, it is not Venus itself that is influencing you to do something, but you can see that something is influencing you through the position of Venus. This something is generally accepted to be an intangible cosmic force – we are unable to detect or measure this in any way except by looking at the patterns of the planets. To that extent, astrology seeks to understand these patterns and help us make decisions around that.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that there are many different types of astrology. The relationship between humans and the skies is something that almost all civilizations sought to understand, and many astrological systems arose to bridge the gap. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Two of the most prominent today are Western astrology and Indian (Vedic) astrology. Unfortunately, these two have incompatible claims, and they follow a different set of rules when it comes to making astrological claims. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>This is an extremely important point which highlights a serious inconsistency in astrology as a subject in general.</strong></p>
<p>Consider an analogy. Two friends of yours call you on a Friday night and say &ldquo;We got three tickets to go see a movie! We will pick you up at 20:00.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When your friends get to your house to pick you up, you ask them: &ldquo;What movie are we going to watch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friend A says: &ldquo;We are going to watch The Joker&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Friend B says: &ldquo;We are going to watch Star Wars&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now, you think <em>wait a minute, these guys are playing with me. They said we are going to watch one movie, and they are giving me different movie names.</em></p>
<p>And you would be right. If there is only one movie to watch, it is impossible that you could watch two different movies. There are only two conclusions to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Only one of your friends is right. You do end up watching The Joker or Star Wars. This means that the other friend was wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both of your friends are wrong. You end up watching another movie.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We are placed in this same conundrum with astrology. Taking only two of the major types of astrology, I am both a Libra (according to Western astrology) and a Virgo (according to Vedic astrology). You might imagine that this has visible implications when it comes to establishing that relationship between us and the heavens.</p>
<p>And what about all the other types of astrology? Who is right in the end?</p>
<h3 id="arbitrary-names-and-real-traits--part-i">Arbitrary names and real traits – Part I</h3>
<p>There is something called the ecliptic which is very important in understanding astrology. The ecliptic is an imaginary line that traces the path of the sun across the sky throughout the year. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/astrology/ecliptic.gif" alt="Image"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1.1 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic">The ecliptic.</a></em></p>
<p>If we look at this path throughout the year, we will notice the sun being in front of different constellations at different times.</p>
<p>A constellation is simply a collection of stars which we gave a name to – there is nothing real that unites them. We just looked at the night sky thousands of years ago and said: &ldquo;Woah, this looks like a half-human, half-horse animal ready to shoot an arrow with his bow!&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s where you get Sagittarius from.</p>
<p>It is a lot like trying to figure out what clouds look like on a sunny day. But, in this case, the names we gave to the stars stuck to this day since the stars do not disappear like clouds do!</p>
<p>The reason why the stars behind the sun do not appear to move is that they are extremely far away. The sun is much closer, and we are orbiting it, so it appears to move across this &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; background of stars.</p>
<p>There are 88 constellations in total, but only 12 of them that are in that path that we talked about, the ecliptic. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> These constellations are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/astrology/constellations.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1.2 - <a href="https://astrologybay.com/">The constellations.</a></em></p>
<p>This is where Western astrology gets their signs from. It is important to note, however, that Western astrology does not deal with the constellations, but with the signs. This is for simplicity.</p>
<p>Different constellations have different sizes in the night sky. Because of that, some of them would take up more space across the ecliptic, and it would not be fair for the other ones. Imagine, for instance, that the Sun was against Sagittarius for 60 days, but against Aries for only 10 days.</p>
<p>To make sure that each sign gets a full month, Western astrologers divided the ecliptic into 12 equal parts. That way, every month the Sun appears to switch a sign, despite the size of the constellation behind that name. We already had a 12-month calendar in the Babylonian times, so dividing the 12 constellations into 12 signs was easy – one for each month.</p>
<p>That is why, today, if you were born between July 22nd and August 22nd, you are a Leo. You were born under the <strong>sign</strong> of Leo, but the constellation may have been something else, because the signs have equal sizes, and the constellations have different sizes.</p>
<p>It is quite smart of Western astrologers to deal with these fixed-sized signs rather than the constellations because this allows them to give an answer to something called precession, which we will get into later.</p>
<p><strong>There is, however, one very important problem here, and it is crucial. Western astrologers do not care about the constellations, they care about the signs.</strong></p>
<p>But there is a deep relationship between the constellations and the signs. After all, the names of the signs came from the constellations. And the attributes behind these signs came from the figures that the constellations represent.</p>
<p>For example, Libra was known in Babylonian astronomy as MUL Zibanu (the &ldquo;scales&rdquo; or &ldquo;balance&rdquo;). The scales were held sacred to the sun god Shamash, who was also the patron of truth and justice. Since then, Libra has been associated with law, fairness, and civility. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>This is extremely important. It means that all the attributes of the sign of Libra were interpreted from what ancient Babylonians thought the constellation looked like.</strong></p>
<p>There is nothing real to base this definition on – as I mentioned, it literally was the case that people looked up at this group of stars and said, &ldquo;this looks like a scale&rdquo;. It could have been a cup, a mug, a dinosaur, a bonfire – or anything. Yet, we chose to stick with this arbitrary definition, and we assigned some real attributes to it.</p>
<p>This personalization of the stars is an example of a recurring theme throughout human history – egocentrism. There are a variety of subjects which involve some sort of pattern recognition in unrelated things for our comfort – in the hopes of making the unknown more human.</p>
<p>We are always trying to explain how it might affect our lives, and what it means to us, humans. The fact of the matter is that these constellations simply do not care at all about us out here. These images we gave them are all based on our imagination for our comfort – they are not grounded in anything real.</p>
<p>The next time you read a horoscope about Leo, for instance, remember that it could have been something entirely different. And the only reason why it is not is that on that very day where someone decided &ldquo;Hey, these random stars look like Lion from this ancient myth we know about&rdquo;.</p>
<p>They could have decided that it looked like a wolf, a deer, a sheep, a horse, or anything. What personality traits would we have in that case?</p>
<h3 id="arbitrary-names-and-real-traits--part-ii">Arbitrary names and real traits – Part II</h3>
<p>One thing I find interesting is how dishonest these egocentric interpretations of celestial objects can be. Take Venus for example.</p>
<p>In Roman Mythology, Venus is the goddess of beauty, love, and fertility. A long time ago, the planet Venus was given its name based on this goddess. To that extent, associations of the planet Venus and goddess Venus were created.</p>
<p>From an astrology <a href="https://cafeastrology.com/venus.html">website</a>: &ldquo;Venus rules our sentiments, what we value, and the pleasure we take in life. Grace, charm, and beauty are all ruled by Venus. Through Venus, we learn about our tastes, pleasures, artistic inclinations, and what makes us happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;Grace, charm, and beauty&rdquo; get me… Let&rsquo;s visit Venus.</p>
<p>Although it is the second closest planet to the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System by far. The temperatures at the surface there reach 462 °C, or 863 °F - hot enough to melt lead.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis says that when the sun was younger and cooler, Venus might have had a mild temperature and even liquid water on its surface. As the sun aged and got warmer, Venus' water began evaporating, leaving a vast amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, which trapped heat in the planet and warmed it even further. This led to a runaway greenhouse gas effect because the planet got so hot that the carbon dioxide in the oceans was dissolved away and carried to the atmosphere. It got so hot that the carbon dioxide in rocks and other terrestrial surfaces got baked away into the atmosphere as well. <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of this, Venus is extremely hot with an incredibly thick atmosphere. The pressure in Venus' atmosphere is around 92 times that of the Earth. It is like the one you would experience if you were around 900 meters down in the water. Have you ever had your ears pop when you swim too deep? Now imagine being 900 meters down. Now imagine that is the pressure on the <em>surface</em> of a planet.</p>
<p>So, if you were on Venus standing on the surface of Venus, you would find yourself being immediately crushed by the pressure, choking to death from the 96% carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, literally melting, and it would also be raining sulfuric acid (but it is so hot that these droplets evaporate before reaching the ground!).</p>
<p>Where exactly does this relate to charm, grace, and beauty? To love and fertility? We have only scratched the surface of what it is like to be on Venus, and it is already clear that it is a place of the imminent destruction of a human being.</p>
<p>We assigned this planet an entirely arbitrary name. We then used the attributes associated with this name to describe the planet itself. And here we stand, thousands of years later, basing our decisions and judging potential partners, for example, based on these arbitrary definitions.</p>
<p>Venus could have been given the name of a Greek goddess, or an Egyptian goddess, or a Norse goddess – what would its attributes be in that case?</p>
<h3 id="the-wobble-of-the-blue-marble---precession">The Wobble of the Blue Marble - Precession</h3>
<p>If you are not at least a little bit confused by now, I am doing a poor job. So, let me add in more confusion through something called precession.</p>
<p>As you might know, the Earth is a sphere and we are a little tilted, which is why we have seasons. This is what we look like, roughly speaking:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/astrology/axis.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1.3 - <a href="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/earth-axis-tilt.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=675&amp;crop=1">The axis of the earth.</a></em></p>
<p>Consider that stick to be the Earth&rsquo;s axis. It is by measuring that, versus an imaginary stick which is upright, that we get the tilt of the Earth (23.5°).</p>
<p>If you were to walk up to the most Northern point in the North Pole (literally where that stick is) and looked right above your head, you would see Polaris. Polaris is what we currently call the North Star because we see it right above our head when we are at the very North of Earth. This is very helpful for navigation.</p>
<p>But Polaris will not always be the North Star. That is because the Earth&rsquo;s axis is rotating. Over time, when we look up from that same point, we will see some other star rather than Polaris. This rotation of the Earth&rsquo;s axis is called precession.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/astrology/precession.gif" alt="Image"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1.4 - <a href="https://calendars.wikia.org/wiki/File:Axial_precession.gif">The precession of the Earth illustrated.</a></em></p>
<p>2,000 years ago, when we were coming up with those names for the constellations, our axis was in a different place. Because of that, for example, if you were to walk up to the North Pole and look right above, you would not see Polaris the way we do today.</p>
<p>Similarly, when we looked up at the sun on October 1st, we would see that it is against the Libra constellation. But, because ~2,000 years have passed, the Earth&rsquo;s axis has rotated a significant amount, and now when we look up again on October 1st, we see that the sun is against Virgo, not Libra.</p>
<p>The rotation of the axis, or precession, does a full turn every 26,000 years. Since around 2,000 years have passed since we named the constellations, we have done about 1/12th of the full rotation. Since there are 12 constellations, this means that we have shifted by about one entire constellation. Which is why we can look at the sky on the same date as we did 2,000 years ago and see Virgo instead of Libra.</p>
<p>Vedic astrology accounts for precession, which is why earlier on I told you that I am a Virgo according to it, and not a Libra.</p>
<p>However, Western astrology, as we saw, does not deal with the constellations. It deals with the signs. That way, no matter the wobble of the earth, October 1st will always be a date in which the sun is under the libra <strong>sign</strong>, but not under the libra <strong>constellation</strong>.</p>
<p>This has some important implications.</p>
<p>The first is the obvious one: if you follow Western astrology, you were not born under the constellation which your sign represents. In my case, my sign is Libra, but the sun was at Virgo during my birth. In general, the constellation at which the sun and the planets were placed against at the time of your birth is the sign behind your current one.</p>
<p>The response to precession by Western astrologers, so far as I understand, is that they do not deal with the constellations, but with the signs. That way, they can keep the twelve signs on the same dates, no matter the precession. They do this by marking the beginning of the sign of Aries on the first day of spring every year (at the northern hemisphere), and then giving each sign one month after that.</p>
<p>But, how can it be that to account for precession, they can claim a sort of no-relationship between the signs and the constellations, when in fact all the definitions of such signs come from the constellations in the first place?</p>
<h3 id="the-issue-of-non-falsifiability">The issue of non-falsifiability</h3>
<p>Our reality is governed by four fundamental forces. Behind every interaction you ever had, everything that you see, and everything that you feel, these four forces lie:</p>
<p>Gravity (what pulls you down when you jump).</p>
<p>Electromagnetism (what keeps our atoms bonded together).</p>
<p>The strong force (what keeps the nucleus of our atoms bonded together).</p>
<p>The weak force (what is responsible for radioactive decay).</p>
<p>The claim astrologers make is that there is another force(s), an undetectable force, which comes from the universe itself and that it affects our lives down here. There has been no evidence to support this claim. It is impossible to measure this force, which makes it impossible to say it that it doesn&rsquo;t exist. This is where the belief in astrology lies.</p>
<p>I will not drag too much on this part because the implications of having something which you cannot see, touch, or measure are self-evident. People believe in different things for different reasons, and I am not someone to judge.</p>
<p>I have beliefs of my own which are not based on anything I can touch, see, or feel. But it is always important to maintain the skeptic mind to prevent the catastrophes that may arise from bad beliefs, as we mentioned early. It is also important to consider this issue of non-falsifiability in combination with all the other points to get a clearer picture of astrology as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="the-studies">The studies</h3>
<p>As we saw, astrology has an inherent non-falsifiability problem which makes it difficult to accurately measure. However, people have done several studies on the relationship between personality traits and birth dates.</p>
<p>I will leave this part to Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, who wrote an in-depth article called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-are-horoscopes-still-thing-180957701/">How Are Horoscopes Still a Thing?</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>From her article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[…] Of all the empirical tests that have been done on astrology, in all fields, says Dr. Chris French, a professor of psychology at London&rsquo;s Goldsmith College who studies belief in the paranormal, &ldquo;They are pretty uniformly bad news for astrologers.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s very little scientific proof that astrology is an accurate predictor of personality traits, future destinies, love lives, or anything else that mass-market astrology claims to know. For example, in a 1985 study published in the journal Nature, Dr. Shawn Carlson of University of California, Berkeley&rsquo;s Physics department found that seasoned astrologers were unable to match individual&rsquo;s star chart with the results of a personality test any better than random chance; in a second test, individuals were unable to choose their own star charts, detailing their astrologically divined personality and character traits, any better than chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A smaller 1990 study conducted by John McGrew and Richard McFall of Indiana University&rsquo;s Psychology department and designed with a group of astrologers, found that astrologers were no better at matching star charts to the corresponding comprehensive case file of a volunteer than a non-astrologer control subject or random chance, and moreover, didn&rsquo;t even agree with each other. A study out in 2003, conducted by former astrologer Dr. Geoffrey Dean and psychologist Dr. Ivan Kelly, tracked the lives of 2,000 subjects who were all born within minutes of one another over several decades. The theory was that if astrological claims about star position and birthdates were true, then the individuals would have shared similar traits; they did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The issue here is that astrologers are smart, and we are willing to accept their claims because it makes us feel good. There is a combination of logical fallacies and psychological effects at play.</p>
<p>An important one is confirmation bias. Wikipedia has a good definition of this: &ldquo;The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that affirms one&rsquo;s prior beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, when confronted with an astrological chart, it is natural that we will favor only the portions which accurately describe us, and ignore the ones which are not so accurate. We give more consideration to the things which re-affirm our belief, rather than those which disagree with us. Confirmation bias is everywhere around us, not just in astrology – we are all guilty of it at some point in time.</p>
<p>The next is the Forer (Barnum) effect. Wikipedia also has a good definition on this: &ldquo;Is a common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them, that are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a short and interesting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si2HoscBLIw">video</a> on the Forer effect if you are interested, which highlights that definition very accurately.</p>
<p>There are a lot of additional biases and psychological effects to consider. Appeal to tradition, appeal to antiquity, appeal to authority, apophenia…</p>
<p>Ultimately, we need to keep in mind that we are fallible and that we may be acting wrong. The examples that I gave had some relation to astrology, but these biases are present everywhere around us, and it is always useful to keep them in mind despite the subject of analysis.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The astrological subject is divided across many practices. Several civilizations have their methods of establishing the relationship between humans and the cosmos. These methods are not in agreement with one another, often yielding completely different answers to the same question. This mutual disagreement is an important point to consider when assessing the validity of an astrological claim.</p>
<p>Further, at the bottom of every prediction, of every sign, of every description, is an egocentric and arbitrary view of the universe. We have personalized the stars, the planets, and the moons to our own needs. We gave them human attributes, and we take from them human influences on our daily lives. By happenstance, we got the signs and the names of the planets which we have today, but they could have been entirely different. This is also a crucial point because it means that all of the attributes from the 12 signs we know today are based on nothing but an arbitrary definition. Further, the traits of the planets are also based on arbitrary definitions, often giving quite a different image than what the planet is actually like.</p>
<p>Science is irreconcilable with the claims of astrology. There is an inherent issue of non-falsifiability, which makes it impossible to test through the scientific method. Additionally, problems like precession and the existence of a 13th constellation cause a lot of headache and confusion, not to mention a wide range of other issues, such as even agreeing on what a &ldquo;planet&rdquo; is.</p>
<p>Many different studies have been done dismissing astrological claims. It is also important to note the difficulty in conducting any study whatsoever in astrology due to the sheer amount of biases that readers may have. Whether or not the astrologer is saying something true, the person reading that message is also guilty of carrying many biases that might influence the overall idea and perception of astrology. The confirmation bias, the Forer effect, apophenia, and others are all very present in any astrological discussion.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>Why have I said all of this?</p>
<p>Because, as I wrote <a href="https://capm96.github.io/blog/parece/">before</a>, I am a proponent of reason. I sincerely believe that the only ailment to most of the problems we have in our world today comes from the pursuit and application of truth. I believe in using reasoning to determine what is bad and using reasoning to determine what is good.</p>
<p>This is the best version of the world we have ever seen. Unprecedented levels of prosperity are everywhere around us. Yet, it is also obvious we are nowhere near perfect. There are still so, so many issues that we could work on. I think we can at least start getting there by being reasonable to each other. There is a great level of respect, humility, and appreciation that comes from thinking deeply about our reality and how incredible it is. In other words, I believe that acknowledging the human condition brings in respect and care for others.</p>
<p>To that extent, I get discouraged when I see such an immense number of people blindly believing in something without questioning it. Not because is bad (because as we saw, astrology is quite personal and harmless) but because of the habit that it creates. This habit of blind acceptance – that is something which can be extremely dangerous. Critical thinking should be more encouraged, so reason can take its place, so we can make a better world for everyone.</p>
<p>I do not have an answer to why someone might choose to believe in astrology. It is, after all, a deeply captivating notion, and we all have our right to believe in whatever we choose to. It is a good feeling of being part of the celestial movements, of having an explanation for our sudden outburst of emotion, for our achievements, and our failures. For reinforcing what we already believe in, and for having something to look forward to in the next month. This is all captivating, but it is not based on truth and reason.</p>
<p>And the beautiful thing about reality is that there is no need to flee from it - the truth can be as magnificent.</p>
<p>I will finish by sharing one image: The Hubble Legacy Field.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/astrology/legacy.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1.5 - <a href="https://hubblesite.org/image/4492/news">Hubble legacy field.</a></em></p>
<p>I cannot post the image on its original size because it is quite heavy – almost as heavy as an entire movie. This large size is accounted by the fact that the original image contains a lot of information.</p>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope spent 16 years gathering light from one point in the sky – and the result was this picture. All that exposure time, all the light captured, converted into one single image.</p>
<p>It is easy to overlook this picture, but think about it for a second. Almost every single dot in that picture is an entire galaxy. A galaxy is a massive collection of billions and billions of stars. The galaxy which we are in, the Milky Way, has about 300 billion stars in it.
In that picture alone there are 265,000 galaxies, each with their billions and billions of stars…</p>
<p>When I am confronted with this, I am left with nothing but humility and awe. What else could I feel? I am but a human, and on the scale of that picture, I am smaller than the smallest thing that I know of. It is beyond my comprehension to understand the scale of what is in that image, only tiny point in space, which contains infinity. As far as I know, am I not looking right into God&rsquo;s window?</p>
<p>This is the truth. And it is also one of the reasons that make me disappointed about the omnipresence of astrology.</p>
<p>Human beings are incredible creatures, the planets are incomprehensible objects, and the cosmos is a place more beautiful than one could ever describe – why diminish these things into patterns, pre-defined movements, in security? There is infinite beauty in the chaos of life and the mystery of the universe.</p>

<p>The definition of &ldquo;planets&rdquo; is one fundamental inconsistency when it comes to astrology as a whole. There is no agreement exactly on what is meant by &ldquo;planets&rdquo;. For instance, Vedic astrology considers the following to be planets: The Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and Rahu-Ketu, the two nodes of the Moon. On the other hand, Western astrology does not consider Rahu-Ketu and some other planets, while considering Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto to be planets. This is a very important point. How can it be that some planets represent an influence, and others do not? It seems impossible that both can be true at the same time. There is also one additional problem that is worth considering. Notice that none of the other planet&rsquo;s moons are mentioned. There are in fact, many other moons out there. Jupiter alone has 79 moons! <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> Jupiter also has the biggest moon in the entire solar system, an object called Ganymede. Ganymede is bigger than Mercury, a planet, which is always relevant in astrology. How come we are leaving out something bigger than Mercury out of the picture? The answer is clearer once we understand that none of these moons were visible at the time in which astrology was being created. And once we finally did find out about all these objects, it might have seemed too cumbersome to include them all in our astrological charts. It is odd, however, that they are not included. If the planets demonstrate an equal influence on our lives, that means that there is no regard for how far away, or how big, a planet is. Jupiter, for instance, is a lot larger and a lot farther than Venus, but we seek to understand their influences on us with equal attention. Then, how come we are leaving out all these moons? What about all the solar system objects – the asteroids and comets? What about stars outside our solar system? If distance and size do not matter, we should be able to include all these other celestial objects in our astrological understanding. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>There is in fact, Ophiuchus, a 13th constellation. As I understand it, Astrologers ignored Ophiuchus for simplicity. Since at the time of the ancient Babylonians we already had a 12-month calendar, it would be much easier to divide the ecliptic into 12 equal parts. Dividing by 13 makes for some confusing math… The sun passes in front of the constellation Ophiuchus between around the 30th of November and the 18th of December. If you were born under that time, you were born against the constellation of Ophiuchus, even though your sign is something else. <a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
