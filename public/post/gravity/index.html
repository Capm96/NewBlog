        <p>If you were asked to explain the most implausible fact you know, but which is also true without a doubt, what would it be?</p>
<p>I am hard pressed to find a single answer. However, one that comes to mind is that space and time are malleable components of the universe, changing under certain circumstances, and rendering extraordinary events such as the bending of time possible.</p>
<p>Physics is an inherently abstract subject most of the times, but what I mentioned is proven repeatedly here on Earth every day. It is a sublime effect which requires measurements of extreme accuracy, but it is here nonetheless.</p>
<p>To that extent, my goal is to illustrate the basics of how space and time work, show why they are subject to change under certain circumstances, and demonstrate the importance of measuring such changes to build an omnipresent feature of our lives - the GPS.</p>
<p>In parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The differences between Newton’s view of space and time to Einstein’s view of space and time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The basics of Einstein’s Special Relativity theory, and why space and time behave counter-intuitively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the Global Positioning System (“GPS”) works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How points 1. and 2. are vital in building a functioning GPS.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Permanent Disclaimer</em></p>
<p>I am not an expert on any of the things I talk about. This is true for everything I write on this website. Let this be an eternal disclaimer from here to all other posts that I am but a bewildered monkey with an equally confused and curious mind making sense of things. My goal is not to give an explanation of perfect accurateness as much as sharing phenomenal ideas that may incite some further learning and/or show you something interesting about reality.</p>
<h3 id="1--the-differences-between-newtons-view-of-space-and-time-to-einsteins-view-of-space-and-time">1.  The differences between Newton’s view of space and time to Einstein’s view of space and time.</h3>
<p>When you think of space and time, what do you see?</p>
<p>“Space” might mean the skies, the ether, or just everything around us.</p>
<p>“Time” is… well, time. It is also self-explanatory but difficult to describe concept – they both seem like intangible built-in features of the universe which are clear to us. If you are anything like me and most other people, you probably see them as two distinct and separate things. There is space, the physical entity, and there is time.</p>
<p>To make sure we are on the same page, however, we first need to arrive at a more useful explanation of space.</p>
<p>The best way to get there it is by imagining everything around you disappear. The device you are reading this on, the floor which you stand on, the scenery around you including all the people, cars, houses, and everything else. Then take away Earth, and the other planets, and the stars until there is only you in the darkness of space, and nothing else.</p>
<p>That is space.</p>
<p>But what is it? One thing which it is <strong>not</strong>, is empty space.</p>
<p>We know this from quantum mechanics, which is not something we will cover here. But if you are curious, quantum mechanics tells us, among other things, that even in what appears to be empty space, there are countless particles randomly coming in and out of existing at every moment.</p>
<p>In any case, here we have it, space. We also have our first point of disagreement between Newton and Einstein.
Newton viewed space as an unchangeable and absolute structure, whereas Einstein viewed it as something that could be bent and twisted, like a piece of clothing.</p>
<p>To see how these two views are different, we need to understand how both men understood gravity.</p>
<p>Newton’s understanding of gravity is the one you are most familiar with. Two objects exert an attractive force which depends on their mass and their distance. An object with heavier mass pulls harder than an object with lower mass, and the closest these objects are, the harder they pull on each other.</p>
<p>This is still an extremely precise description of <strong>how</strong> gravity works, and we use Newton’s formulas to this day, but he was not able to tell <strong>why</strong> this gravity exists.</p>
<p>Einstein’s understanding of gravity is a lot more counter-intuitive, and unlike Newton, it involves the space we just defined. Also unlike Newton, it helps us understand the “why” question.</p>
<p>Remember that I told you that space itself could be bent and twisted? The Einstein model predicts that objects weigh-down on the fabric of space itself, like a bowling ball on top of a mattress, and that the bending of that fabric is what causes gravity.</p>
<p>Picture yourself getting a bowling ball and placing it on the middle of your mattress. You will notice that the weight of the ball pushes down the mattress at the middle, creating a sort of curvature around the bowling ball. If you now tried rolling a tennis ball from one end of the bed to the other, you would notice that its path is altered by the curvature from the bowling ball in the middle.</p>
<p>The universe works in the exact same way.</p>
<p>In the picture below, Earth (the bowling ball) curves space (your mattress) and that curvature of space causes the moon (tennis ball) to alter its path through space (your mattress).</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/gravity/curvature.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1.1 - <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einsteins-genius-changed-sciences-perception-gravity">The curvature of spacetime illustrated.</a></em></p>
<p>This is a fascinating realization, and although abstract at the moment, highlights the genius realization of Einstein - that space itself is malleable, and that what we think of gravity is fundamentally curvatures along this malleable fabric.</p>
<p>Now that we understand how they both viewed space, we can attend to their perspectives on time. Luckily for us, their disagreement on time is similar to their disagreement on space.</p>
<p>Newton believed that, like space, time was a distinct and absolute entity separate from everything else.</p>
<p>Einstein, on the other hand, refused the notion of absoluteness put forth by Newton to describe space and time. To him, it was impossible to detach the notion of time from the notion of space, because one cannot exist without the other. To that extent, he believed that the same curvature of space was also applied to time, which can lead to some strange things, as we shall see.</p>
<p>Imagine your phone for example. If it existed in a physical location, but at no point in time (ever), how would you find it?
Or imagine if your phone existed for all eternity, but in no physical location, how would you find it?</p>
<p>Everything has to exist in both space and time for us to be able to perceive it. It thus seems that there is a fundamental, intrinsic relationship between space and time. And that is exactly what physicists in the late 19th century began realizing.</p>
<p>Hermann Minkowski, one of the mathematicians during the time, once said:
“<em>Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>Minkowski also helped us visualize this relationship between space and time with the Minkowski diagram. We will not go into too much detail on this, but you might see how this to visualize oddities about time later. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="2-the-basics-of-einsteins-special-relativity-theory-and-why-spacetime-behaves-counter-intuitively">2. The basics of Einstein’s Special Relativity theory, and why spacetime behaves counter-intuitively.</h3>
<p>Now that we understand the nature of a unified spacetime, we can begin looking at when it acts extraordinarily.</p>
<p>When you are driving down the highway at 100 km/h, what does that speed imply?</p>
<p>If I was at another car next to yours and was also driving at 100 km/h in the same direction, relative to me you would not be moving at all, while relative to the ground we are both moving at 100 km/h.</p>
<p>If you accelerated and started driving at a 120 km/h, you would be moving away from me at 20 km/h, while moving away from the ground at 120 km/h.</p>
<p>If there was a car moving at 100 km/h per hour in the opposite direction of ours, we would see it coming towards us at 200 km/h.</p>
<p>So, who is right? Who has the “absolute” speed, which is the true measure of how fast something really is going?</p>
<p>Nobody. All motion is relative.</p>
<p>This is where the name Special Relativity comes in. This theory was an expansion of Newtonian physics to dispel the idea of absolute space and time, and propose that there are many faces to what we call spacetime, and that people can view it differently while being simultaneously right &ndash; something impossible in the Newtonian framework.</p>
<p>This idea of relativity, however, is not entirely new. Galileo himself had already understood that motion was relative, but during his time Newton’s mechanics of an absolute space and time still reigned, and his relativity did not make much headway. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>It was not until the late 19th century, however, that physicists and mathematicians would revisit Galilean’s relativity to dispel Newton’s absolute time and space. And the fundamental reason why they were able to do this is the following:</p>
<p><strong>The speed of light is a universal constant.</strong></p>
<p>This may seem like something easy to overlook, but consider what we just saw about relative motion.</p>
<p>As we saw, motion is always relative – a car might be going at 0 km/h, 100 km/h, or even 200 km/h, depending on who is watching it.</p>
<p>Light does not work that way. Light is always, unequivocally, regardless of the circumstances, traveling exactly at 299,792,458 meters per second. Always and infinitely, every single time we measured it, this exact speed comes out, no matter who is looking at it and under what circumstances they are looking at it. If you are going towards a flashlight&rsquo;s beam at 100,000,000 meters per second, the flashlight&rsquo;s beam would still appear to be moving towards you at the speed of light. This is counter-intuitive because as we just saw with the examples of the cars, velocities get added most of the time.</p>
<p>This is such a fundamental property of the universe, in fact, that it rests as one of the two building blocks of Special Relativity. Without it, Einstein would have never figured any of this out. The other building block of Special Relativity is that the laws of physics are the same for everyone. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>And there we have it, the recipe and the ingredients we need for among the strangest things in the entire universe:</p>
<p>A)	The laws of physics being equal for everyone.</p>
<p>B)	The speed of light always being the same.</p>
<p>C)	Not having such a thing as absolute space and absolute time.</p>
<p>So, what can this theory of Special Relativity tell us?</p>
<p>For one thing, it can tell us that time can pass at different rates for different people.</p>
<p>We can get there by following the postulates mentioned above, and thinking about an (extremely exaggerated) scenario to illustrate the theory.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine we have two brothers, Bob and Alice, which are both at a train station.</p>
<p>Both brothers are carrying with them an interesting clock, a light-clock. This clock is made of two mirrors, one at the bottom, and one way up. The clock ticks every time a light beam goes from the bottom mirror to the top mirror and back again (a full-trip) as such:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/gravity/lightclock.gif" alt="Image"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1.2 - <a href="http://www.emc2-explained.info/The-Light-Clock/#.XPw7qIhKhEZ">Light clock.</a></em></p>
<p>Now, consider that Bob is standing stationary in the waiting area, facing the trains, while Alice is inside the train, moving away from the station at a constant speed. Both of them have their clocks with them.</p>
<p>For Bob, who is sitting still, his clock will tick every second, as expected. However, when he looks at Alice’s clock, he will notice something strange.</p>
<p>Alice is moving, and so is her clock, so the beam of light has to travel a larger distance to reach the top mirror, and it also has to travel a larger distance to reach the bottom mirror. In other words, the light beam takes longer to make a full round-trip.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/gravity/movingclock2.gif" alt="Image"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1.3 - <a href="http://www.emc2-explained.info/The-Light-Clock/#.XPw7qIhKhEZ">Moving light clock.</a></em></p>
<p>Now, the crucial and most fundamental part of all of this is that the speed of light is the exact same for Bob and Alice.
And as you might recall <strong>distance = speed * time</strong>.</p>
<p>Alice’s light beam, from Bob’s perspective, had a larger distance to travel then his own clock. We can see this from the two visualization&rsquo;s above.</p>
<p><strong>However, the speed of both light for beams is constant, and so if in our equation (distance = speed * time) distance has increased, and since speed is constant, the only variable that can change to balance it is time.</strong></p>
<p>There is no way to increase or decrease the speed of light, so spacetime itself has altered to protect the fact that the speed of light is constant. Remember how we mentioned that spacetime was a malleable fabric, with nothing absolute about it? This is how it can be bent and twisted, to preserve its own sanity.</p>
<p>From what we saw, we can conclude that Alice’s clock took longer to do a full trip, meaning that time for Alice has slowed down relative to Bob. This is an insane conclusion. People can really experience time differently.</p>
<p>Notice, however, that we can add into our confusion by saying that from Alice&rsquo;s perspective, it was Bob who was moving, and therefore it was his time that slowed down, not Alice&rsquo;s. In fact, it is actually true that Alice will continue experiencing time normally &ndash; it is simply a matter of relative observations. From Bob&rsquo;s perspective, her time seems to be running slower, while from her perspective, everything is normal.</p>
<p>The truth, however, is that Alice&rsquo;s time seemed to run slower from Bob&rsquo;s perspective, although both of them experienced reality normally. In other words, we could say that Alice was aging slower than Bob.</p>
<p>Hendrik Lorentz, a Dutch physicist that was incredibly important in putting all of this together, derived a formula that tells us  exactly by what factor time will appear to run slower for someone. This formula yields something called the Lorentz factor. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In our case, if for instance, Alice was moving so fast that when we ran our Lorentz equation, we got a factor of 2, that would mean that for two years that Bob experiences, Alice will only experience one. Notice, however, that both of them would live these years normally, as if nothing strange was going on. It is a peculiar concept to visualize, but that is what happens when spacetime itself awakens.</p>
<p>The name of these relative differences in time is called Time Dilation, and it is a very real effect, which as we shall see, is vital to our navigation systems.</p>
<p>It is not, however, the only weird thing about Special Relativity.</p>
<p>We will not dive deep into this, but Special Relativity also states moving observers not only have their clocks slow down, but they also appear to be contracted in length relative to someone observing them. That would mean that if someone was watching you move really fast, you would not only appear to be experiencing time differently, but you would also appear to be much shorter in length than you are.  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="3-how-the-global-positioning-system-gps-works">3. How the Global Positioning System (“GPS”) works.</h3>
<p>GPS, or NAVSTAR Global Positioning System, is a collection of US-made satellites orbiting our planet. The GPS was initially an American military initiative, but it has spread over civilian life ubiquitously. Other countries also have their own “GPS” networks:</p>
<p>Russia – Glonass.</p>
<p>European Union – Galileo.</p>
<p>China – Beidou 2.</p>
<p>And others.</p>
<p>In any case, we will be referring to GPS from now on.</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>At every given moment, your phone is being bombarded with signals from the GPS satellites in orbit around our planet.</p>
<p>These signals travel at the speed of light, and they carry with them information about the position of the satellites. They travel in all directions from the satellite, in a circle.</p>
<p>When you open the GPS application on your phone, the software does something called Trilateration (which I previously confused with triangulation [a measure of angles]).</p>
<p>Trilateration means combining received signals from at least three different satellites and pinpointing an intersection point between such signals to precisely determine where your the phone is.</p>
<p>For example, if one satellite broadcasts its signals, it will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/gravity/sat1.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1.4 - <a href="https://gisgeography.com/trilateration-triangulation-gps/">GPS illustration.</a></em></p>
<p>Your phone receives the signal, but since it only got information from one satellite, it cannot know exactly where it is. This is because the signal that the phone receives only contains the location of the satellite, and how long the signal took to get from the satellite to your phone &ndash; this means that the blue area you see are all the other possible locations your phone could be in.</p>
<p>If you keep repeating the process with more satellites, however, you can draw an intersection between different signals to pick up your exact location, since they all converge to a very accurate position, as demonstrated in the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/gravity/sat2.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1.5 - <a href="https://gisgeography.com/trilateration-triangulation-gps/">GPS illustration pt 2.</a></em></p>
<p>In short, this is how your phone is able to tell you where you are on the planet.</p>
<p>However, to yield such extremely accurate measurements, the clocks from our phones and the satellites need to be perfectly synchronized. Because light travels quite fast, even extremely small changes in their clocks would account for vast differences in distance, which would give you an inaccurate position. In other words, our phones need to know exactly how long it took for the signal from the satellite to reach our phones so that it can draw those potential location circles we saw. If the timing is off, the circle will be off, and our position will be no good.</p>
<p>This is exactly where Special Relativity that we saw comes into play.</p>
<h3 id="4why-gps-needs-special-relativity">4.	Why GPS needs Special Relativity.</h3>
<p>I lied.</p>
<p>The truth is, time dilation does not occur only for moving objects. It is also happening to you and me right now, even when we are standing still.</p>
<p>Remember that I told you spacetime is malleable because large objects like our planet weigh down on its fabric and cause it to bend?</p>
<p><strong>It turns out that this gravitational bending also causes time dilation.</strong></p>
<p>If you have ever seen Interstellar this is exactly what happens when they go into the planet that is near the black hole. A black hole is an object of such astounding gravity that the curvature of space around it is ridiculously extreme, and so when they landed on that planet, one hour for them there was equivalent to seven years on Earth.</p>
<p>This gravitational effect on spacetime was included in Einstein’s second theory of relativity, the General Theory of relativity, which is a whole new beast we will leave alone for now. However, whereas &ldquo;Special&rdquo; only means dealing with objects moving at a constant speed, &ldquo;General&rdquo; also includes the effects of gravity into the picture.</p>
<p>In any case, we now know that moving objects experience time more slowly, and we also know that objects being affected by gravity also experience time more slowly.</p>
<p>The GPS satellites are orbiting our planet an average speed of around 4 km/s. If we plug this our the Lorentz factor calculation, we get a relative time difference of about 7 microseconds per day, meaning that the satellite&rsquo;s clock runs slower by 7 microseconds per day.</p>
<p>However, as we saw, gravity also causes time dilation, and we experience gravity more strongly than the satellites because we are much closer to Earth&rsquo;s center of mass than the satellites, which fly 20km above the ground. Thus, putting these differences in height into our measurements, we can determine that our clocks run 45 microseconds slower in comparison to the satellite&rsquo;s clocks.</p>
<p>In the end, we net out the effects of speed and gravity, and we reach the conclusion that, per day, our clocks run 38 microseconds slower than the satellite&rsquo;s clocks.</p>
<p>If left unaccounted for, this difference would yield an imprecision of C (the speed of light) * 38 microseconds per day, which is equivalent to around 11 km per day.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine picking up your GPS and only knowing the degree of accuracy of your position by 11 km instead of the usual 15 meters.</strong> And this effect would compound daily. At the end of a month, the GPS might say you are in central park when really you are in front of the white house.</p>
<p>The people who build the satellites corrected for this relativistic effects by altering the frequency at which the satellite&rsquo;s clock runs, namely making it slower to match Earth’s clocks.</p>
<p>If you are curious, the frequency of the satellite clocks before launch is 10.22999999543 MHz., while ours on Earth are 12.3 MHz. It is this tiny difference that keeps guiding us home every day, and this is all thanks to some very, very brilliant people.</p>
<p>I already wrote an entire post on ignorance, trust, and gratitude, but I’d like to re-emphasize that theme here one more time.</p>
<p>When you open the GPS on your phone and it guides you to where you want to go, you might not notice it, but underneath it, everything that I just told you, and so much more, goes on under the hood.</p>
<p>Not only that, but think about the engineering and collaborate effort behind even thinking about such a thing. The building of satellites, the building of rockets to launch such satellites in space, an infrastructure to monitor, modify, and maintain all these satellites in orbit and functioning perfectly well, operating applications to run on every device to pinpoint your precise location instantaneously by combining signals from multiple flying robots in the atmosphere&hellip; The effort to think, discover, and account for a fundamental weirdness of the universe, all to keep us on the right track, all under the click of a button.</p>
<p>I cannot think of anything else to say but thank you.</p>

<p>The Minkowski diagram helps illustrate spacetime continuum in a cartesian plane. Much the same way you would use a 2D plane to describe the position of anything in a 2D environment, the Minkowski diagram helps illustrate the position of anything in the real world. It does this by plotting time in one axis, and space in the other axis.  Keep in mind that this is a 2D visualization of something that is in reality 4D (we have the three dimensions of space we are familiar with from everyday life, plus the one of time). However, it helps illustrate the union between space and time into the so-called Spacetime continuum. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The fundamental notion of Galilean relativity is that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial (non-accelerating) observers. However, as we shall see, the Galilean transformations, as opposed to the Lorentz transformations, took into consideration an absolute time and absolute space. Further, Galileo was also not aware of the fact that the speed of light is a universal constant. The experiments which allowed us to understand the speed of light in the 19th century, combined with the brilliant mind of Einstein, is what allowed us to progress from Galilean relativity to Special relativity. However, notice that the realizations of Galileo&rsquo;s observations are important to us even today. If you are on a plane, flying at constant speed, and you drop your phone on the ground, you will notice that the phone falls in a straight line, even though the plane is moving at hundreds of kilometers per hour. This happens because the laws of physics are the same for objects in motion, and thankfully, everything within that airplane is also moving at the exact speed the plane is moving. This relativity is also the same reason why we don&rsquo;t notice that we are flying through space at 1,600 km/h. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The technical terminology for the two postulates of Special Relativity are: A) The laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames (where inertial means non-accelerating, and reference frames means observers) B) That the speed of light traveling through the vacuum of spacetime is constant. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The Lorentz factor equation is = 1/√(1-v<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/c<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) where v is the velocity of the moving object, and c is the speed of light. For instance, an object moving at half the speed of light would yield a Lorentz factor of 1.1550, meaning that time would run 1.1550 times slower for the moving observer relative to the stationary one. This is an interesting discovery because it shows that even for extremely high speeds (half the speed of light) the time dilation appears to be rather small. Things have in fact to be moving extremely fast to have some sort of hyperbolic time dilation effect. <a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The Lorentz transformations for time dilation and length contraction can be better visualized through the Minkowski diagram. As we saw, the speed of light is a universal constant. With that being said, we can say that this diagram&rsquo;s space axis represents an interval of 300 million meters between every two ticks (the speed of light through one second) so that the speed of light appears to have a linear slope. Now, as we said, spacetime itself must change to preserve this constant speed of light, so you can imagine that if you have any two objects within the worldline (inside the lines of the speed of light, since nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, it would be impossible to have an object to the other side of the lines) the graph will appear to shrink and stretch in a weird way to keep the speed of light constant but make the time relative between the observers. <a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
