        <h3 id="ignorance">Ignorance</h3>
<p>One of the great things about Astronomy is its unparalleled ability to create a sense of awe and humility. It is quite an astonishing effect. All it takes is looking up at the night sky and observing a glitch in our mind unfold. But before we do this, there are a few things to keep in mind. The first is to know what a light-year is.</p>
<p>Confusingly, a light-year is not a measure of time, but a measure of distance. It is the distance light travels throughout an entire year in the vacuum of space, or,  9.46 trillion kilometers.</p>
<p>Side note – here we notice the first glitch already. Can we visualize this number?</p>
<p>In any case, that is a light-year. We could measure every type of distance through light-years, but it does not suit our purposes very well. For example, imagine trying to figure out how long a marathon is in light-years instead of kilometers. Spoiler: 0.0000000000044 light-years!</p>
<p>However, not all is so abstract. There are some interesting results of measuring distances through the speed of light. For instance, the moon is about 1.3 light-seconds away from us (384,400 km). The sun is about 8 light-minutes away from us (150,000,000 km).</p>
<p>How does this relate to ignorance?</p>
<p>Well, already we can notice something: that trying to think about light-seconds, minutes, or years is an extremely confusing process to run. Our brains were not equipped for it. When we read these numbers, we understand that they are immense, but it seems inherently impossible to comprehend exactly how immense. It is something beyond our reasoning at this moment.</p>
<p>Now that we have equipped ourselves with the tool of understanding how little we understand, let us look at the night sky.</p>
<p>When we look at up at the night sky, every star that we see is extremely far away from us. Find the <strong>closest</strong> star to us, Proxima Centauri, and it would be at 4.2 light-years away. If there was a bridge that we could take from Earth to Proxima Centauri, in which we could drive at a highway speed of around 100 km/h, it would take us around 400 billion hours to get there.</p>
<p>That is equivalent to around 45 million years.</p>
<p>Assuming our average life span is 80 years, we would have to live around 570,000 lives and drive straight to Proxima Centauri during every single second, of every single day, of every single year of all our lives at a speed of 100 km/h to reach our destination on time.</p>
<p>This is the CLOSEST star to us of all the stars in the universe. But remember that there are more stars than grains of sand on this entire planet.</p>
<p>How can we process this information? It is difficult. Looking at the night sky brings down an unparalleled sense of infinite incomprehension, and now we are seeing that this incomprehension is only rivaled by the minuscule scale of our beings – so let us continue.</p>
<p>Let us look at one of the farthest stars we can see with our naked eye, V762 Cas, which is over 16,000 light-years away. Multiply everything we have just talked about by 4,000 and there we have it: now we are equally as confused but the star is a lot farther away!</p>
<p>Now, remember that every single star that we see in the night sky is part of the Milky Way galaxy, which is a conglomeration of celestial objects spanning a diameter of about 100,000 light-years.</p>
<p>We need to pause for a second and think about this number.</p>
<p>That same extremely fast distance that we spoke about, which could go around Earth 7 times in a single second, which could reach the moon in one second, which could reach Proxima Centauri in 4 years while it took us 45 million years, it would take this same speed 100,000 years to get from the beginning to the end of our Milky Way galaxy. 
We are not going to foolishly attempt to draw an analogy on how long it would take to drive from one end to the other on a bridge because our computer might crash in calculating it.</p>
<p>And this is only the Milky Way galaxy. There are so, so many other galaxies out there. Trillions of them, maybe an infinite amount.</p>
<p>Our closest neighbor galaxy, Andromeda, is about 2 million light-years away from us. An unfathomable distance, but which is relatively nothing compared to the scale of the universe. There are galaxies as far as 13 billion light-years away from us.</p>
<p>Fun fact: we are on a collision course with Andromeda! In about 4.5 billion years, our two galaxies will collide. However, the universe is so vast and galaxies are so unfathomably large that even though there are billions of stars in each galaxy, almost none of these stars will actually collide. There is just that much space between each of the stars.</p>
<p>Anyways, we do not stop here, for everything we spoke about is only within the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe we can see. There is still so much more, perhaps an infinite amount, which we cannot see.</p>
<p>The point is that if we have the right key, looking at the night sky means opening a door of infinite grandiosity which unequivocally exposes our utter inability to grasp what lies in front of our eyes.</p>
<p>In any case, why are we venturing here?</p>
<p>Because looking up at the night sky is only one of the many ways in which our ignorance, our inability to think deeply about certain things, is visibly demonstrated. 
All it takes is looking up and trying to put things in perspective. But this does not have to involve Astronomy, I just happened to talk about it because it is something I think about often. The truth is that there are countless other ways in which this ignorance can also be seen.</p>
<p>Look in front of you.</p>
<p>The words which you are reading now, what are they made of? How does a computer even work, from the quantum mechanical level to this website? What about the trillions of synapses firing in our brains every second, absorbing the information and transforming it into something meaningful?</p>
<p>Look in any direction around you, and keep pushing yourself with “why” or “how”, and I promise that eventually, you will reach the wall of ignorance. We can get to this wall of ignorance with tangible things, like going down the rabbit hole of how our computer works, or we can get there with more abstract things, like looking up at the night sky, or we can get there with really abstract things, like asking ourselves why is there a universe in the first place. Inevitably, however, we reach a place of mystery.</p>
<p>It seems to me that as far as we can tell, human beings have passed a certain threshold of intelligence that is in a sense incompatible with our biological capabilities – we are only capable of understanding how little we understand, and nothing more. We can open doors, but we cannot walk through them yet.</p>
<p>But just because we cannot comprehend certain things, it does not mean that they are bad or that we are stupid. Quite the opposite.</p>
<h2 id="trust">Trust</h2>
<p>In human society, trust is the invisible glue that holds everything together.</p>
<p>Let us take stock of our belongings. If you are reading this, you probably own a computer and/or a phone, and subsequently access to the internet. You also most likely have a house, a bed, clothes, food, access to electricity and water, etc. Since I wrote this, I share these same privileges.</p>
<p>How many of the things above did we create ourselves?</p>
<p>Our computers, the access to the internet we need to open this page, the fabric of the clothes we are wearing, the battery that charges our phones, the car that drives us to work, the fertilizer that is used in the vegetables that we eat – how involved were we in making such things?</p>
<p>Not involved at all.</p>
<p>The vast majority, if not every single belonging we have, is the creation of other human beings. This is the point where trust becomes embedded in society.</p>
<p>We trust our internet provider to grant us internet access.
We trust our food to be delivered without anomalies that make us sick.
We trust our oven to work properly and not leak and explode.</p>
<p>We could go on and on forever! Just think about everything we use every single day. And now think of how many of those things we made ourselves.</p>
<p>Even the fundamental way of acquiring all these things is entirely and solely built on trust. Money itself is the single greatest example of trust in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Yuval Noah Harari talks about this extensively in his book, <em>Sapiens</em>. To him, money is the single greatest myth ever told, and I agree with him. The paper that we carry around is worthless – we only use it as a means of exchange because we trust each other to uphold their end of the bargain and keep using that same paper as further means of exchange. If citizens in a country were divided about their trust in money, society as we know it would not work – it either is accepted by everyone, or it is not.</p>
<p>Trust is everywhere in our lives. From our clothes to our internet to our food to our transportation. No one lives in isolation. We are all part of a system where an individual can acquire things which he did not build (and trust them to work) since he could not do it himself. 
Most importantly, he buys it with trust (money). And even the others which provide us with something that we need were also provided with something they could not make themselves. It is a perpetual, self-increasing cycle which everyone is part of.</p>
<p>As we have seen, repeating questions of “how” and “why” will ultimately lead to an unmovable wall of ignorance. And this is everywhere in our lives. Look at the GPS on our phones, for example.</p>
<p>I do not know how to make the satellites, the computer programs, or the infrastructure required to capture and utilize the extremely complicated data that a GPS needs. 
Just think about all the steps involved in this enterprise! We would need rockets, supercomputers, a global network, complicated software… If we were asked to make a GPS by ourselves, we would probably not know where to even begin! A single person can&rsquo;t put all of this together.</p>
<p>Such things are so complex that they can only be built through the arduous collaboration between brilliant people. What is beautiful about this is how much trust and joint effort needs to be involved in something like building a GPS. There are so many steps to it that the only hope to get it working is to do one’s part and hope that the other part works as expected.</p>
<p>The people building the rockets do not need to know about how the Google Maps app is designed. The people designing the Google Maps app do not need to know how the satellites to send the data are being built. And the people building the satellite do not need to know how the rocket is being built, so long as it works!</p>
<p>Nobody can do it all themselves. The only way to create something so magnificent that will benefit so many people is if there is a mutual trust between the parties so that everybody can do their parts and ultimately combine them to create something greater than the sum of all its components.</p>
<p>Our complete ignorance on this entire GPS-building venture leads us to unequivocally trust the people who make such things, and hope that when we use it, it works as expected. For us, it is as easy as picking up our phone, clicking on a button, and finding ourselves guided to wherever we need to go. But the work behind this…</p>
<p>This same logic can be applied to almost anything in our lives. We just need to remember everything that we did not make (and which we do not know how to make), but which we expect to work. 
The GPS is a specific example, but we can pick absolutely anything and find ourselves completely lost as to how it even exists. Electricity, transportation, healthcare… things a lot of us, unfortunately, take for granted in some places of the world, but which have unequivocally made our lives better. They are a true gift.</p>
<p>It seems that our ignorance can not only be exposed by more abstract ways, such as looking at the night sky, but by literally looking around us and thinking about how those things even exist. It is amazing to me that we can benefit from such incredible breakthroughs and advancements without having absolutely nothing to do with them. Unbeknownst to us, millions of hours have been spent crafting tools that help us shape reality to a more favorable condition, allowing us to thrive and live more comfortable lives.</p>
<p>The more we look, the more we find how little we know. Or, in the words of Einstein, “As our circle of knowledge expands, so does the circumference of darkness surrounding it.” But we do not need to be blinded by our ignorance, for humanity is not the measure of a single individual’s circle of darkness, as much as it is the sum of all circles of knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="gratitude">Gratitude</h2>
<p>In every direction we look, in every part of our lives, we can find something which we are completely ignorant about and which we completely rely on others to provide us with.</p>
<p>With this realization that we are but simple individuals, part of something much greater than ourselves, that we are reliant on others and that absolutely nothing of what we have today would have been possible if it were not for the billions of others who have preceded us, what is left?</p>
<p>To me, there is nothing left but gratitude.</p>
<p>Looking up at the night sky makes me feel like I am smaller than the smallest thing I know. It makes me aware of the fact that I am not equipped to think about certain things – it imposes on me the very definition of being a human, and with it its limitations and capabilities.</p>
<p>Looking around me makes me feel like I am standing on top of a mountain which was carved through arduous labor which I am completely oblivious about. It makes me aware of the fact that the ground which I stand on today was built by other people more disciplined than me, smarter than me, more well-prepared than me, and I trust them with almost everything I have in my life.</p>
<p>And once I stand on top of these mountains and look up at the night sky, then the absurdity of it all comes together at me, washing away any sense of pride with a wave of humilty, and I feel an overwhelming feeling of ignorance, of trust, and gratitude. For standing here and being who I am today. For being given the opportunity to think about these things. For having the opportunity to take part in what others have built before me.</p>
<p>And then maybe, just maybe, I can convert some of this gratitude into willpower to keep carving these mountains higher and higher, allowing our fellow human beings to peek at the skies from higher and higher up above, so one day our mountain reaches its zenith we can look up at the skies without having to keep climbing any further.</p>
<h1 id="-">-</h1>
<p>Dear reader, if you reached this far, thank you. Life is difficult. Having GPS or a warm shower is undeniably helpful, but that does not touch the burden that being a human being carries. We all suffer. Furthermore, not all of us can even have a GPS or a warm shower. For billions around the world, those materialistic privileges do not exist.</p>
<p>But this does not need to be the end of the story. The truth is right in front of our eyes: we are smaller than the smallest things we can think of, and the only thing we have is each other.</p>
<p>And when we put our heads together, we rise out of the darkness. We go from witch hunts to making satellites, antibiotics, and Netflix comedies.</p>
<p>Why would we want to do anything else? Why would we waste time terrorizing each other, killing each other, and putting our fellow human beings through suffering? Look up! Are we that different?</p>
<p>Maybe I am naïve, but I believe there will come a day where we stand above the idiotic ideas that have haunted humanity for so long. That we will be able to overlook all the indefensible prejudices we have created to segregate ourselves. That our racial, religious, monetary, or any status will not matter, and that we will be able to look at each other and see what we genuinely are: brothers and sisters from the bellies of stars, wandering around this blue marble in a sea of infinity, and that it would be nice if we could walk side by side, so that we can craft a reality which is pleasant for everyone, and that pain is no more.</p>
