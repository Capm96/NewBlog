When I was a kid, my mom gave me a very special book called *Parece mas não é*.

In Portuguese, “Parece mas não é” translates to something along the lines of “Looks like *it*, but it is not *it* ”, as in “Looks like a duck, but it is not a duck” or “Looks like a house, but it is not a house.”  

The book consists of cartoonish drawings. In fact, there are almost no words in it. The drawings depict things you see in everyday life, such as a snapshot of a busy street with cars, streetlights, and buildings. But when you look closely at some of these things, you start to notice that they *look* like cars, streetlights, and buildings, but they *are* not cars, streetlights, and buildings. For example, the cars’ wheels are coins, the streetlights are pens, and the buildings are made of cards.

But not everything is necessarily made of random objects, and that is the fun of the book – it is up to you to figure out what *Parece mas não é*! However, the pictures are very well-drawn, and things are beautifully disguised so that it is not obvious to know what is real and what is not.

As a kid, I wanted to find out all the things that should not be there. But thinking about this book today makes me think of something different... The idea that it gives me is that we, generally, only *see* the world in one way – and that is how we normally see it in our everyday lives without giving it too much thought. When we walk down the street, we don’t think deeply about the cars, the streetlights, and the buildings – they *are* what they are, and that is the end of it.

We see, we hear, and we feel everything around us. We all have histories, and we all have notions of why things are the way they are. Our reality is ours, but is that the only way of viewing it? Or, if we looked closely (as in the book), could we start to notice things that *look* like, but *are* not? Further, what might happen if we do learn how to look at things differently, or, seeing something which *Parece mas não é*?

### The universe as a LEGO set

Imagine you just came home from the mall with a Star Wars-themed set of LEGO toys. You go into the living room, clean the floor, open the box, and stare at all the things you can build. The Death Star, the Millennium Falcon, the Imperial Destroyer... all that good stuff.

You spend some time working on it and finally everything is done. All the little LEGO pieces have been assembled in the right way, and you have built a beautiful Star Wars scene in your living room.

Suppose now that you were asked the question: “How different is each LEGO toy from the other?” For instance, how different is the Death Star from the Millennium Falcon? While the “how different” part can be more subjective, there are two objective considerations to include in one’s answer to that question.

The first objective consideration is that the fundamental components of each LEGO toy are the exact same. Each toy is made of a combination of the single little LEGO building blocks that we love to step on so much. These little blocks might be different in color, shape, or size, but they are all the smallest building blocks nonetheless (and it seems that the pain they inflict upon being stepped on is the same!). Whether we want to make the Death Star or the Millennium Falcon, we need to get a bunch of these individual LEGO units and put them together.

The second objective definition is that the only reason why any two toys are different is that the little building blocks making them were different. For instance, the little building blocks making up the Death Star are in different size and color than the ones making the Millennium Falcon. Further, the building blocks were also arranged in different shapes – the Death Star is a sphere while the Millennium Falcon is more like a triangle, so to build such things, we need differently-shaped building blocks. But, if we were to get the same set of little building blocks, of the same color, of the same size, and arrange them in the exact same way, then we would have two exactly equal LEGO toys.

So, while we may have different opinions on how different the Death Star is from the Millennium Falcon, we can agree that **the reason they are different is that their building blocks were different and/or were arranged differently**.

After a while, you are done with all this LEGO business and you go in the kitchen to make a sandwich. You open the drawer, get the bread out and put some peanut butter and jelly on it.

Suppose now that you were asked a similar question to the first: “How different are you from the sandwich you just made?”

Without thinking too much about it, most of us would probably say: “We are completely different! There is nothing between me and this sandwich. I am a human and this is a piece of bread with peanut butter and jelly on it.”

This seems obvious to all of us, and I don’t think anyone even spends time thinking about this while eating their PBJ sandwiches! But what if what *looked* like two separate things, *were* not that separate?

That sandwich is made of countless molecules bundled together. Proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and other nutrients and minerals. Farther down, these molecules are also built from even smaller things: atoms.

Atoms are an incredibly abstract part of our lives. Together they make up almost everything that has ever existed (and that will ever exist) but you have never even seen one of them! They are, in a sense, equally as mysterious as the skies (but in the opposite direction) and make us stand humbly in the middle of things much beyond ourselves.

How are the little LEGO building blocks any different in their functionality than atoms? Both the LEGO building blocks and atoms come in different shapes, sizes, and they can be arranged in many ways to build all sorts of things. For instance, that bread you ate is mostly made up of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and some other atoms. All these atoms were arranged in a specific way, so that altogether they made up a piece of bread. Had these same atoms been arranged differently, they could have been pasta or rice!

However, there is something else which is made up of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and some other atoms, and that is you. It is also every single one of the 100 billion people that have ever lived on this planet. Everyone that you know, and everyone that you have ever heard about is literally made of the same stuff that bread is made of.

There are more building blocks though, and they make up everything else. They are in the oceans,  rocks, rockets, whales, apples, computers, stars, comets, and everything and anything else we can think of. **We are all part of a gigantic LEGO set called the universe, and everything in it is made of the exact same set of building blocks, just arranged in different ways.**

Because of this, our answer to that question of “How different is the Death Star toy from the Millennium Falcon toy” is equivalent to “How different am I from a piece of bread”, and the answer to both questions does not seem to be far off from "not so different at all"...

To me, this notion of a fundamental unity is enough to dispel many of the ghosts which have haunted, and still haunt, our world to this day. Think about the misery, suffering, and pain brought onto other humans in the name of racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, and all the countless other forms of discrimination, prejudice, hate, and ignorance that have existed.

How could one truly stand firm behind any of such beliefs given the fact we are all made of the same things? How can we accept to judge someone in such ways when the only reason we are any different whatsoever is that our own building blocks were arranged in different ways, and we happened to be born on different places in this gigantic LEGO set? The connection between all things in nature is inescapable.

Granted, this is an abstract concept. The unparalleled griefs brought forth from the mentioned horrors will not cease to exist from one day to another, even if we acknowledged the fact of our unity. However, I do firmly believe there is extraordinary benefit in recognizing that although we may *look* different from one another, we really *are* the same.

Your personal beliefs, personality traits, ambitions, hair color, favorite food – all these attributes are the way they are because you were born in “X” place at “Y” time with “Z” circumstances happening in your life (childhood, family, culture...). If we were able to strip ourselves one atom at a time, we would eventually find that we are all made of the same material as any other human being who has ever lived, and that our uniqueness lies only in how we were placed in the universal LEGO set.

As a side note, I think it is important to consider the implications of this because they can be easily misrepresented. Understanding that we are elementally the same does not radically change anything – it may simply act as a catalyst for empathy and humility. Our inescapable connection should act as a light to dispel the hatred imposed by our own ignorance.

And I do not mean this in a spiritual “woo-woo” type of way, I mean: “Hey, this person I am yelling at during traffic is exactly like me – we came from the exact same place and we are only different because of our histories. There are infinitely more things that unite us than things that separate us.” This might lead one to realize that maybe wasting energy yelling at each other is not so helpful. As Seneca said, "We are all flowers of the same garden."

All the atoms that make up our world today came from stars, like our sun. Our sun is a gargantuan ball of gas, mostly hydrogen, which is so hot and dense that at its core, the hydrogen atoms fuse with each other to make new, heavier atoms. The energy that is released in this process is our sunlight, warm and life-giving.

Throughout unfathomable time spans stars go through their lives, creating many different types of atoms in their core. At the end of their lives, all these different atoms are released in space through an unparalleled explosion -- a supernova. The leftovers from this explosion are attracted to each other through gravity, and they end up building new things, like a planet. And in this planet, and in you, and in everything, all these atoms are present. The building blocks of everything were created in the furnace inside the core of stars, which were once created from a single point in spacetime, the big bang.

Everything came from the same place. One gigantic LEGO set spilled across the skies the universe. Billions of years, generations upon generations of stars, fire, chaos, and order... all amalgamated into the unbelievably beautiful, painful, and divine reality we experience every single day. As Carl Sagan said, “The Cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.”

Things might *look* like they are different, but they really *are* not so  different at all!

### A hundred monkeys on a wooden raft

I enjoy reading about history because it makes me feel quite grateful for being alive today. The books of history contain the best and the worst of humanity, and understanding our past can create a useful inner compass of reason for navigating the present. But sometimes when I read about history I get extraordinarily shaken, for what I read seems to be so brutal that an immense sensation of grief overwhelms me.

I am talking about the nefarious atrocities committed which are so dark, grotesque, and unspeakable that one could never really talk about it – we can only refer to their ghosts. The Atlantic slave trade, the Witch Hunts, the Holocaust, the Gulags, the Genocides, the Wars, the Inquisitions, and all the other monstrosities that have happened and still happen to this day.

This is an excerpt from Iris Chang’s book *The Rape of Nanking*, which talks about the Japanese invasion of China in 1937.

**Warning: this is a very vivid and repulsive excerpt.**

“On December 13, 1937, thirty Japanese soldiers came to the Chinese home at 5 Hsing Lu Kao in the southeastern part of Nanking. They killed the landlord when he opened the door, and then Mr. Hsia, a tenant who had fallen to his knees to beg them not to kill anyone else. When the landlord’s wife asked why they murdered her husband, they shot her dead. The Japanese then dragged Mrs. Hsia from under a table in the guest hall where she had tried to hide with her one-year-old baby. They stripped her, raped her, then bayoneted her in the chest when they were finished. The soldiers thrust a perfume bottle in her vagina and also killed the baby by bayonet. Then they went into the next room, where they found Mrs. Hsia’s parents and two teenage daughters. The grandmother, who tried to protect the girls from rape, was shot by revolver; the grandfather clasped the body of his wife and was killed immediately.

The soldiers then stripped the girls and took turns raping them: the sixteen-year-old by two or three men, the fourteen-year-old by three. The Japanese not only stabbed the older girl to death after raping her but rammed a bamboo cane into her vagina. The younger one was simply bayoneted and “spared the horrible treatment meted out to her sister and mother,” a foreigner later wrote of the scene. The soldiers also bayoneted another sister, aged eight, when she hid with her four-year-old sister under the blankets of a bed. The four-year-old remained under the blankets so long she nearly suffocated. She was to endure brain damage for the rest of her life from the lack of oxygen.“

Needless to say, such horror exists. It has existed, and it can exist for very long if we do not learn to do otherwise. Why did we, and why do we still, do these things to each other? I do not have a complete and simple answer. It is a terribly complicated question which is much beyond my scope of analysis, but I sincerely believe that one of the fundamental underlying causes is ignorance.

We were incapable of using reason, truth, and dialogue to reach the conclusions about what is just, and what should be the best  objective course of action for everyone. Instead, too much power was given to people with too much unwillingness to reason, and the result was death. We were unable to see ourselves for what we really are, and we let the shadows of hatred, intolerance, ignorance, and deception blind us.

The light to dispel these shadows, I believe, is the truth, because truth is what prevents such terribly ignorant and misplaced ideas from creating a standing ground. It is the fundamental component of a just and reasonable existence. Dr. Jordan Peterson explained this better than I possibly could:

“Life is suffering. Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated. Truth is the handmaiden of love. Dialogue is the pathway to truth. Humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn. To learn is to die voluntarily and be born again, in great ways and small. So, speech must be untrammeled, so that dialogue can take place; so that we can all humbly learn, so that truth can serve love, so that suffering can be ameliorated, so that we can all stumble forward, so to speak, towards the kingdom of God.”

We can be better, all of us, if we can speak and live according to the truth. We should not assume that reality is exactly how we *see* it, because often things *are* much different than they look! In fact, we might be *seeing* things which are very far from the truth, things that drives us to places where we commit the genocides, the witch hunts, and the gulags! All places built upon foundations of non-reason, built upon foundations of deception, of places where things *looked* a certain way, but where in fact completely misinterpreted!

So how can we go from *looking* at each other in many (often deceptive) ways to understanding how we truly *are*?

Imagine you wake up in a huge wooden raft on the middle of the ocean. There are other 99 people in this raft. None of you know where you came from, or where you are going – you all woke up in this raft equally as confused. There is no land in sight, only water in every direction.

What could you and these people do? It is a strange circumstance after all. But there are ultimately two different ways to manage this situation:

1) People in the raft cooperate to reach a common goal for everyone – finding land as fast as possible. The means of reaching that goal may vary, but in this case, everyone agrees that this is a very urgent situation, and they all agree to keep going north. They all work towards this common goal in an efficient and collaborative manner, realizing that, in spite of not knowing each other, they are now dependent and stuck to each other.

2) People in the raft do not cooperate to reach a common goal for everyone – there is an inability to reason, enhance efficiency, and work together. Some individuals with strong beliefs are unable to have a truthful dialogue about the situation, and soon enough sections of people are created, with the “Southerners”, “Westerners”, “Easterners”, and “Northerners” continuously bickering with each other about which direction to go to. The sections sabotage, exploit, and fight each other – at the end of the day, the different sections try going in different directions, and the raft does not go anywhere.

It seems to be unequivocally clear that we too are doing a type 2 management of our raft, the Earth. We are quite literally flying through a possibly infinite space at this very moment, without knowing where we came from, and without knowing where we are going. We have divided ourselves into sections (countries), and we are also unable to agree on how to best manage our raft.

People are not willing to admit that they are wrong, that their beliefs may cause unnecessary pain. There is little mutual agreement about where we should go – our sections are simply unable to cooperate. Look at our geopolitical systems, internationally and domestically, they are for the most part extremely divided. We deliberately choose to beat on each other rather than agreeing that we are all on the same raft, and that we could be doing better if we cooperated.

Imagine for instance, on that gigantic wooden raft, that people in the different sections started cutting down the wood on the edges of the raft so that they could build weapons to “protect” themselves from other sections, instead of using that wood to build a shelter for everyone. Spears and shields to attack each other, and no protection from the rain and cold that comes from the ocean. From an outside perspective, that would be an incredibly silly and inefficient way of living.

Do we not do the exact same thing with our planet? How many wars and deaths, and how much suffering and pain have been brought forth in the name of resources, finite resources, so that we could feed our own sections, or even worse, a tiny minority of our sections?
What could we have done with these resources if we weren’t so preoccupied with “protecting” ourselves from each other?

Per year the world spends around US$1.8 trillion in military spending. I am not going to even suggest a complete eradication of military spending, because that is farfetched idea even for this already farfetched subject, but imagine we started acting in cooperation, and among all the things which would flourish under this cooperation, the first would be that we could reduce some of the military spending since we will not threat each other as much anymore. Say we saved only 20% of this budget at first.

That is equivalent to US$360 billion per year – enough to solve so many of the unnecessary burdens we deal with today. Think of the improvements in global education, healthcare, infrastructure, and general quality of life if we could manage this specific amount of money – which would be only the first step in a long road. We could even reshape the planet we have been squandering for so long.

What is stopping us?

A lot – this is an immensely complicated question. But for one, the way we *look* at things. We are not really seeing that we *are* all on a gigantic raft. We are not really seeing that we all made of the same things, coming from the same place, and going to the same place. There is so much more that unites us than what divides us. And we are unable to see that truth!

Yes, countries have profound and complicated differences, and our collective history is no stranger to conflict, but all it takes is looking up at the night sky, for instance, to understand how small even the grandiosity of humanity is.

And while all of these ideas about cooperation may be farfetched and incredibly difficult to really implement, there is nothing hindering us from using them as catalysts of empathy, unity, and togetherness towards each other. Our international relations will not solve themselves if we, as individuals, keep acting divisively – global change must be built up from the individual, and the individual can change his behavior for better by acting towards the truth.

If you look at it closely, you will see that we really are apes floating on a small planet in the middle of a great void, and that we are all much more alike than apart, and that maybe, for one, it would be a good idea to stop praying to the heavens and acting poorly towards each other, and instead focus on building heaven with our own hands, here on Earth.
