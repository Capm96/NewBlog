At this point in your life, you probably have wondered several times about how something might have turned out had certain events happened differently.

“What if I had done this?” or “What if I had not done that?”

These “what if” questions seem to be a ghost of our rationality, embedded within every human given our unique capacity to think about the past, the present, and the future. Seamlessly traveling through time in our minds can be a powerful but daunting ability.

I believe there is a great room for discussion on the importance of asking these questions to oneself. Should we ask them often and analyze the causes and consequences of certain events, or should we ignore these memories and focus instead on what is ahead of us?

We will leave this more individualistic/philosophic discussion for now, and instead talk about the “what if” questions that have unequivocally shaped history. These are questions that when assessed, show completely different paths for humanity altogether had the underlying events happened another way.

A common example of such a question to us is “What if Hitler was never born?”.

Were the conditions in Germany post the First World War so precarious that even if Hitler were not born, another person would come to power with the same ideas? Or was this man simply so idiosyncratic that had he not been born, Germany would have never invaded Poland and ignited the most horrific conflict in the history of mankind?

Who knows? We only have one reference point. And that is what did, in fact, unfortunately happen.

But perhaps there is some benefit in thinking of the alternative scenarios. It can help us assess more accurately what was undoubtedly true at the time of the “what if” event, and use that truth to accurately draw what might have happened otherwise.

An interesting exercise, therefore, could be to think about the most impactful “what if” questions, in terms of how much the alternative scenarios from such events would have altered history as we know it.

To that extent, I would like to tell you about one specific event that I heard about while listening to Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History podcast.

This is the story behind the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, then heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, and whose murder was the igniting point of the First World War.

I believe this makes an extraordinary “what if” scenario because of two main reasons:

1) It is undoubtedly a pivotal moment in the course of history.

2) The reason why this day happened the way it did was the product of perhaps one of the greatest coincidences of all time – meaning that this day could have happened differently quite easily.

Consider the arguments that if it were not for the First, maybe the Second World War would not have happened, and what that could have meant for our world. The unparalleled grandiosity of the consequences on this single day makes this story worth exploring.

### Setting the stage

_Figure 1.1 - [Map of the Balkan region in the early 20th century.](https://alphahistory.com/worldwar1/balkans/)_

The Balkans, pictured in the above, is a small region in Southeastern Europe with a long and rich history. The geographical location and the diverse ethnicities (Slavic, Greek, Turkish, etc) of the region made it a melting pot of cultural exchange and mercantile activities for centuries.

A large part of the Balkans had been under Ottoman rule from the 14th century to the early 20th century. At the end of that period, however, the Ottoman rule began to crumble, and it was almost entirely driven off by the two Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913, unveiling the independence of countries such as Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria.

European powers of the time had been interested in the Balkans for two main reasons:

1. Its geographical location, which enabled a connection point between Austria-Hungary, Russia, and the rest of the Ottoman Empire.

2. The question of what would happen to the stability of the region now that the Ottoman empire was gone.

The region also carried some larger-scale importance as it displayed the differing European diplomatic relations at the time. More specifically, Germany was allied with Austria-Hungary, while Russia was allied with Serbia.

### The brewing of the blaze

Austria-Hungary had annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina by 1908. Bosnia was a Slavic-descendant country which did not really want to be under Austrian rule. Serbia, also a country of Slavic-descent, wanted to annex Bosnia to create a broader pan-Slavic empire. The threats of this territorial expansion by Serbia are some of the reasons why Austria-Hungary sought the support of Germany in case of war.

By 1914, the tensions amidst these threats of territorial expansions, enhanced by the backing of powerful allies and possibility of a major breakout war, created a thin sense of stability in the region.

To aggravate the problem, the Archduke was to travel to Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, for military exercises. These exercises, among other things, were intended to display to Serbia that Austria-Hungary would not be threatened by the possibility of conflict and that it was ready for war. In fact, the Austrians chose June 28th, 1914 to hold this parade for a key reason.

June 28th is a national holiday for Serbians because, in June 28th of 1389, the Serbian forces were defeated by the Ottoman empire in Kosovo, and this date would be the first celebration of the holiday since Serbia had won back Kosovo after the second Balkan War. Some ultra-nationalistic Serbs saw this as a grave insult and sought to retaliate against Austria-Hungary.

### The beginning of madness

On the morning of June 28th, the Archduke and his wife began rolling down on an open car along a motorcade in Appel Quay, a major street running through the center of Sarajevo.

Their route was pre-published in advance so that people could position themselves to see the Archduke and his wife. However, that also gave the opportunity for the terrorists to position themselves; six members of a Serbian ultra-nationalistic group called the Black Hand placed themselves throughout Appel Quay, waiting for their opportunity to attack.

The Black Hand had as its aim to unite all Slavic countries within the Balkan region under one empire, and killing the Archduke of the country who currently annexed Bosnia was an important objective to stir conflict and achieve their goals.

The first terrorist to act was Nedeljko Čabrinović, who threw a bomb at the Archduke’s car. This bomb bounced off the car and fell behind the vehicle, causing an explosion that injured around 20 people.

Čabrinović, following his failed assassination attempt, took a cyanide pill and jumped into a nearby river. However, the cyanide pill was stale, and it only caused him a stomach ache. Further, the river was only 13 centimeters deep during summer, so he could not drown either. He was quickly beaten and arrested.

With the commotion caused by the explosion, the Archduke was hurried along to the Town Hall, where he met with Sarajevo’s mayor. Enraged, he was quoted to have claimed: *“I come here as your guest and your people greet me with bombs!”*. Nonetheless, his wife was able to calm him down, and the Archduke decided to go to the city hospital and visit the wounded from the blast.

General Oskar Potiorek, an Austrian-Hungarian army officer who was at the time the governor of Bosnia & Herzegovina, and who was also traveling with the Archduke and his wife in the vehicle when they were attacked, suggested that they go to the hospital through Appel Quay again, claiming that an alternative route might be too dangerous.

This was because, despite the attacks in Appel Quay, alternative streets were not prepared in advance for the arrival of the Archduke, and it would be difficult to get through the civilians, while also making the Archduke more vulnerable due to the proximity to other people.

**However, Potiorek failed to communicate this change in plans to the vehicle’s driver, who also did not speak the language.** The driver was a Czech man and the Archduke and Potiorek were speaking in German. Potiorek's assistant, who was injured during the blast, was at the hospital and was not able to translate to the Archduke’s driver that they should proceed to the hospital through Appel Quay instead of taking another street.

Because of this, rather than going to the hospital primarily on Appel Quay, the driver took a right turn which would lead him to another street on the path to the hospital. Immediately noticing that this was not the way, Potiorek made the driver stop the car to reverse his path.

However, it was not so easy to reverse a car in those days. Potiorek also had to explain to the driver that they should keep going through Appel Quay. Although these events would have not taken too long to unfold on a normal day, they took enough time on that June 28th.

As fate would have it, Gavrilo Princip, one of the six initial terrorists, was waiting outside a general grocery store, when the Archduke and his wife literally stood still in an open vehicle right in front of him.

Princip fired two shots which killed the Archduke and his wife, and the rest is history.

### What ifs

We can recognize the plethora of “what if” questions that arise when we learn about this day.

What if the Archduke never went to Sarajevo?

What if the Black Hand never acted to kill the Archduke?

What if the Archduke decided to stay in the town hall until it was safe to leave?

What if the driver stayed in the right direction?

What if ...?

Maybe we would have a completely different world today.

### What ifs multiplied by Infinity

If you have read my Ignorance, Trust, and Gratitude post, you will recall me mentioning that looking at the skies imposes on the observer the very definition of being a human being. That is, it imposes on someone the fundamental limitations of our existence, and shows us that there are doors which we can easily open but never walk through.

There is also another way of putting oneself in that position through the concept of infinity. You have heard of infinity before; it is something which never, ever ends.

It is one of these strange things in life we can talk about and use in our conversations, but that we can never fully grasp. I know this for a fact because no brain or computer that has ever existed could process infinity.

For example (this is a totally made up and non-scientific analogy) if your brain required 0.01% of its power to think of any single number, then thinking of infinity would blow your brain up.

Not only that, you still would be infinitely far away from the end once your brain blew up – because you will never get to the end.

This is true for computers too. Try linking together every single computer in the world and then make them write numbers until they cannot anymore. They will all, unequivocally, crash – and it wouldn’t be even close to the end. In fact, they would be as close from the end as someone who has thought of only a single number – that is the magnitude infinity.

Anyhow, there is another fun way of thinking about infinity which doesn’t involve the blowing of our brains up and that is also linked to the “what if” questions we mentioned.

Consider for a moment the not so implausible possibility that there is an infinite number of universes out there. This is an extremely abstract thought, but we can think about it in an interesting way.

If the above is true, **then every single event which has a non-zero probability of occurring, will occur. Not only that, it will occur an infinite number of times.** What this means is that given enough time and trials, all events that can happen will happen.

Consider the lottery for instance. According to Lottery USA, the chances of someone willing the Mega Millions Jackpot (currently at around US$45 million) are 1 in 302.6 million. This means that, on average, you would have to play the game 302.6 million times before you win your first jackpot.

But what if you could play it 605.2 million times? In that case, you would probably win twice.

What if you could play the game 6 billion times? In that case, you would probably win twenty jackpots.

Now, what if you could play the game an infinite number of times? Then you would probably win an infinite number of times.

No matter what you are wondering about, if there is a non-zero chance of it happening, then it will happen somewhere at some point.

Even if you have something that is a trillion times less likely than winning the Mega Millions Powerball, then this event will happen an infinite number of times if there are an infinite number of universes. There are simply too many trials for it not to happen – eventually, it must occur, and since it can occur once, and we have infinite universes, then it will occur infinitely.

On the story of the Archduke, we could agree that there was a non-zero chance that his driver would have taken the correct street and Franz Ferdinand would never have been killed.

Or the chance that he did not even show up in Sarajevo in the first place.

Or the chance (incredibly small but non-zero) that an asteroid would have hit Sarajevo that same day.

No matter what it is, no matter how small the likelihood of it happening, so long as it is a non-zero number, then this event will happen, and it will happen not once, not twice, but rather billions of billions of billions of infinite times.

In that case, then, if there are an infinite number of universes, that June 28th, 1914 day has surely played out differently, and perhaps the whole of mankind history also played out differently.

I wonder if I am writing this exact same post there.
