_Disclaimer: None of this should be considered as financial advice. Please do your own research before investing anything. There is no easy way to make money. The goal here is to introduce one of the thousands of ways one might invest their money, and why it can be a good idea for some people._

Think back about everything we forgot from our educational years… Why was so much time spent memorizing what a covalent bond is, instead of how to deal with the inevitable stresses of life? Why prioritize something which only a small minority of students will ever use, instead of focusing on something which all students will go through?

As much as I admire education and value its importance, I believe that the core curriculum most schools have is overwhelmingly inadequate. It prepares students for cookie-cutter exams to place them into cookie-cutter boxes. Seldom do schools inspire our interests, engage our critical thinking, or prepare us for anything that the world might throw at us. 

And one of the many things the world might throw at us is: “Hey, are you saving money?” 

Personal finance is completely neglected in most schools. Amazingly, some places that teach “business” will rant about what a corporation is and how to read a financial statement, but at no point they tell us what a credit card is and when we should get one. And forget about budgeting, saving, or anything that might be useful for us – all that is important are the accounting rules!

And so, we march. And years later we look back and realize that we have completely forgotten about those accounting rules, or what a covalent bond is. Yet we still have a mountain of troubles to climb, and we look around and realize we were left unequipped by our educational system. 

Fortunately, we live in a time where information is everywhere, and we can teach ourselves what we missed in our schools. Saving/investing is a common concern for many of us, and I would like to introduce one path to this deceiving subject.

There are thousands of ways in which one could invest their money. These ways depend on many factors: how much time someone is willing to wait, how much risk they are willing to accept, what their goals are, what they know about the market they are investing, what their current financial situation is, and many others.

For many of us, however, the profile is the same: 

* We want to put a little bit away at the end of every month, so that we can save for the long-term (first car, first house, retirement, etc.)
* We do not want to take on too much risk.
* We do not know much about finance, and we can't spend too much time on this. It should be simple.

The following tries to address what someone with that profile might do, and untangle a tiny amount of the financial mess our world displays, and show that behind these curtains lies something which is not as complicated as we might believe.

## Stocks

Imagine we decided to open a bakery. We know how to bake, and we have a store, but we need an initial investment to get our business running (buy our equipment, hire our employees, make our advertising, etc.)

This is where we will use stocks, which are also called shares. Shares are one way in which we can raise money. They are literal pieces of paper that allow us to divide our business ownership however we like, so we can sell it for the cash we need.

We use shares because they make life a lot easier. Think of our bakery for instance – it is just a store with a kitchen in the back. If you and I owned this store, how could we put a line on what is mine and what is yours? 

It would be difficult and inefficient to say: “Alright, I’ll own the storefront and you own the kitchen.”

Both parts depend on each other, and together they make up the entire business. So, if dividing the actual building is hard, what we could do is create pieces of paper to represent the ownership in the company. Now, instead of trying to paint our line on the floor of our store, we could just create these pieces of paper, and give half to me and half to you!

We could divide the bakery’s ownership in 10, 100, or 1000 shares – it is down to preference. Let us divide our bakery ownership into 100 shares. This means that each share represents a 1% ownership of our business. You and I each own 50 shares. 

We then reach out to an investor and tell them: “Hey, we have this incredible bakery that will make some money. Do you want to invest in the business to get us started?”

“Okay.” replies the investor. (This is what shows like Shark Tank are all about).

Now, let us assume that we sold to that investor 20 shares for a total of $1,000. Now our business ownership is divided this way: 40% you, 40% me, and 20% the investor. We now own a little less of the business, but in exchange for that, we got the cash we needed to get our business running!

We finally open our business. In the first month, we record a profit of $1,000. In our bakery, as in any business, the profits usually go back to the owners. And they go according to how many shares they each have. In our case, since our profit was $1,000, you and I would get $400 each, and our investor would get $200. 

If our bakery started generating more profits, it would catch the attention of new investors because they would want to receive part of our profits as well. To receive part of these profits, the new investors would have to buy our shares, which would increase their value. 

This increase in value happens because of the most fundamental law in economics: supply and demand. The more demand there is for something, the more its price rises. This happens because people get on top of each other to buy things. 

During this pandemic, for instance, many places that sold face masks saw the price of these items increase. Why? Because you do not need to sell a mask for $1 when other people are willing to pay $2 for it. And if everyone is willing to pay $5 for it, well, then you can sell all your masks for $5 – the price of any product is how much people are willing to pay for it.

Conversely, the more supply there is of something, the lower the price falls. Imagine that a gigantic alien ship swung by the earth and dropped a kilo of diamonds for every single human being on the planet. What would happen to the idea of prestige and exclusivity surrounding diamonds? 

It would disappear since now everyone owns some. And because there are so many diamonds, the people that used to sell them will have to drive down their prices if they want to keep selling diamonds. They must drive down these prices because why would a consumer be willing to pay so much money for something they could get from anybody else?

The shares of our business are no exception to this law of supply and demand – if a lot of people are trying to buy it, its price will go up. If a lot of people are trying to sell it, its price will go down.

Almost nothing in the economy is exempt from this law – from cars, to video games, to university tuitions – the price of anything is what people are willing to pay for it. We make prices.

In any case, the months go by and our bakery only gets better and better. We keep increasing our profits, and we put ourselves on a solid upward trajectory. This increases the demand for our shares because investors want to buy them to earn some of our profits.

The first investor who bought 20 shares for $1,000 now might be able to sell these same 20 shares for $3,000 – it will depend on how much the new investors are willing to pay!

And that is a share: 

1. A piece of paper that allows us to divide our business. If our business has buildings, for example, dividing that by drawing lines on the floor is impossible. It is much easier to create these pieces of paper that represent the ownership of the business and distribute those accordingly.
2. Each share represents a certain % of ownership of the business. The number of shares a business has is a bit arbitrary.
3. During the first time we sell our shares to investors, we exchange them for cash which we can use to start our business. 
4. How many shares each business owner has defines how much they will take of the profits.
5. The price of a share, and the price of almost anything in general, follows the law of supply and demand. If many people are trying to buy it, the price will increase. If many people are trying to sell it, the price will decrease. 

## Stock Market
A stock market, such as the New York Stock Exchange, or “NYSE”, is a place where people like you and I can buy and sell stocks. Stocks just like the ones from our bakery. 

But now we need to make an important distinction. Earlier, when we sold our shares to our investor for the first time, we were doing something called a primary market transaction.

Primary market transactions happen when a business sells its shares to the investors for the first time in exchange for cash. In this initial transaction, the actual ownership of the company is transferred from the business founders to the investors. 

The NYSE does not operate this way! The NYSE is a secondary market. When you buy Apple shares on the NYSE, you are not giving money to Apple. You are buying the shares from another investor, which could be another individual just like you. None of the money goes to Apple. This is an exchange conducted solely between you and the person selling the share.

_Figure 1.1 - My amazing powerpoint skills._

So, if when we put money in the stock market, we are not actually giving money to a company, what are we doing? 

Essentially… gambling.

Today we can go online and buy an Apple share. For that to happen, someone on the opposite side of the screen went online and sold an Apple share. A transaction is settled.

The person that is buying believes the price of the share will increase, thus making them a return.

The person that is selling believes the price of the share will decrease, so they are trying to get out early.

Who is right?

Well, nobody is consistently right… This happens because no one can predict what will happen tomorrow. 

How can we know that Facebook is going to undergo a massive lawsuit? How can we know that Tesla is going to release a new car?

We cannot. Nobody can. Every single exchange that takes place in a stock market is a gamble. You are placing a bet on the direction of the share price, and there is absolutely nothing that you can rely on to help you predict what will happen tomorrow.

How often are people correct in their bets?

[Not](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/more-evidence-that-its-really-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-finance-professionals-cant-do-it/) [very](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) [often](https://www.ft.com/content/592fcf3e-b005-4263-b30b-6f28db16fa95) [!](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-investing-as-an-individual-is-so-difficult-2019-12-11)

This is not to say that every one that is involved with stock trading is wasting their time – far from it. Certain companies can indeed prove to be useful for managing their investors’ money. 

Wealth managers dedicate their entire careers around understanding the financial world, and although they might not be able to know what will happen tomorrow, they can provide some good guidance in times of financial turmoil.

Other companies, like Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffet’s company), have a business model that revolves around investing in specific companies, and their success indicates that they are mostly getting it right.

However, for the average individual, picking stocks is an extremely unfavorable position to be in. We do not know what will happen tomorrow! But while it is true that individual transactions are gambles, it is also true that the stock market tends to increase in value over time. This is not an effect of gambling, but an effect of economics.

As time goes on, the economy grows, which gives people more income, which they use to buy more products, which generates profits for companies, who will grow and produce more things, and the economy grows…

And within this cycle, more money in the economy means more money being put into the pockets of the people, which means more money being put into the stock market. 

And as we saw, when there is more demand for something, its price will increase. Thus, more money going in the stock market increases the prices of its shares, which increases the total stock market value.

_Figure 1.2 - [Google SP&500.](https://www.google.com/search?q=sp500&rlz=1C1AVFC_enUS821US821&oq=sp500&aqs=chrome.0.35i39l2j0j69i61j69i60l2j69i61j69i60.800j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)_


The graph above shows the US stock market value over 30+ years. In this time frame, the effects of economics we mentioned can be seen. It takes a long time for these cycles to take place, but almost all countries become richer with time, and their stock markets tend to have the shape above.

Weekly, however, not enough time has lapsed to give way to these economic effects. In such a short-term, the market is solely dictated by the sum of all gambles we spoke of earlier. Weekly, the stock market can look like this:

![Image](/images/blog/etf/sp-short-term.jpg)

_Figure 1.3 - [Google SP&500.](https://www.google.com/search?q=sp500&rlz=1C1AVFC_enUS821US821&oq=sp500&aqs=chrome.0.35i39l2j0j69i61j69i60l2j69i61j69i60.800j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)_

This difference in graphs reflects the things we mentioned earlier. 

In the short term, the market is much more influenced by gambles: money is going in and out of the market quickly, with no clear direction. People will not become richer overnight, and so the amount of money going in and out of the stock market is nearly constant.

In the long term, the overall value of the market tends to grow as the economy grows. Now enough time has passed for people to have more money, which they will often use to put in the stock market, increasing demand, increasing value…

One way of seeing this is that the stock market is constantly a gamble. The difference is that over time, people have more money to gamble with! And with more money, they can buy more shares, which increases their price, which increases the market value…

In any case, the ride of the stock market is never smooth. Even on that long-term graph, there are many places where you see the line going down. The 2000’s internet bubble, the 2008 recession, and now with the Covid-19 pandemic.

Over time though, economies seem to almost always recover. And as they grow, the value of the stock market will also grow. However, this is not a guarantee. Not all stock markets rise with time. But, in general, they tend to do so.

We will use this fact that the market seems to increase in value over time to our advantage. The madness of trading can be left to the professionals. We do not want to take gambles. We want to plan in the long-term. We want to ride the upwards trajectory shown in the first graph. 

In summary:

1. A stock market is a place where people like you and I can buy and sell shares.
2. None of the transactions in the stock market give money to the company – the transaction only transfers money between the buyer and the seller, which could be Liz and Sue down the street.
3. It is impossible to predict what the stock market will do tomorrow. It is also impossible to predict what an individual company will do.
4. Share prices are affected by supply and demand. If a lot of people are trying to buy it, prices go up. If a lot of people are trying to sell it, prices go down.
5. Economies tend to grow over time. As economies grow, its people have more money to spend, and part of it goes into the stock market. As we saw, more demand for something increases its price. And more money in the stock market increases its value.
6. The stock market is volatile in the short-term – gambling takes over (daily, weekly, even yearly).
7. The stock market tends to grow in the long-term – economics takes over (over many years).

## Enter ETFs

Remember the first graph we saw of the stock market over the long-term? Imagine that is like a wave. We want to make a boat to ride it. 

We will be creating a boat that will move exactly as the stock market does. If the market goes down 5%, we go down 5%. If the market goes up 10%, we go up 10%. Our goal is to do exactly what the stock market does.

The good thing about this boat is that it requires little maintenance. Once we create it, we do not have to do anything else. We will let it ride for years and years without even looking at it. This is a long-term strategy. As we saw, if we replicate the market, we might have volatile swings every week. In the long term, however, we can make good returns. 

To create this boat, we will use an Exchange Traded Fund, or “ETF”. An ETF works by gathering shares in exact proportion to the stock market so that whatever happens to the stock market, happens to our boat.

For instance, say that the American stock market has two companies in it: Apple and Microsoft. Imagine also that each of these companies has 1,000 shares, each worth $1. 

To build our boat, we will replicate the ratio of the stock market. Since it is split 50/50 between Apple and Microsoft, our boat will also be split 50/50 between Apple and Microsoft.

Then, let’s say that our boat has 10 Apple shares and 10 Microsoft shares.

Day 1: Stock market is worth $2,000. (1,000 Apple shares * $1) + (1,000 Microsoft shares * $1). </br>
Day 1: Boat is worth $20. (10 Apple shares * $1) + (10 Microsoft shares * $1).

Imagine that on the next day, some news comes out about Apple releasing a new iPhone. Apple shares increase by 20% instantly.

Day 2: Stock market is worth $2,200. (1,000 Apple shares * $1.2) + (1,000 Microsoft shares * $1). </br>
Day 2: Boat is worth $22. (10 Apple shares * $1.2) + (10 Microsoft shares * $1).

Both the stock market and our boat increased 10% in value! And just like this movement, our boat will follow every single one of the stock market’s footsteps. 

Over time the hope is that we rise, just like that first graph we saw. This could take many years. But, as we saw, the tendency is that economies grow with time, and so their stock markets are expected to rise too. 

The reason it is important to replicate the exact ratio of the stock market is that we want to minimize the risks of gambling. Say that on Day 1, instead of filling our boat 10/10 with Apple and Microsoft shares, we instead did 5/15 because we really like Bill Gates.

In this situation, we would still benefit from the Apple shares increasing in value, but our overall boat would have only increased 5%, compared to the 10% increase in the stock market.
Conversely, it could have been the case in which we could have went 15/5 on Apple to Microsoft, in which case we would be happy.

But again, how do we know? How could we know that Apple would release a new iPhone? 

Essentially, the market is telling you: “Hey, the current ratio of Apple to Microsoft is 10/10.” And if you move anywhere which is not 10/10, you are claiming that it should be otherwise. You could be betting on Microsoft being more important, or you could be betting on Apple being more important, but how do you know?

The principle above can be expanded to argue against selecting a single stock for investing. One might say: “Amazon has been on a great run, why not put all the money in it?”

Because how do we know it will keep doing that? It would be quite risky to put all our eggs into one basket.

“Okay, let’s put half into Amazon and half into Microsoft”.

Still, quite risky. Only relying on two stocks which are both technology firms (same sector shares risks).

We could keep extending these debates until we reach the entire market (where our boat is!), at which point no further diversification is possible. And the more diversified your portfolio is, the safer you are. True, you will also lose the possibility of large returns on a single stock, but as we mentioned, this is an investment strategy for people that do not want to take too much risk.

So here is where we find ourselves:

We know that picking individual stocks is a gamble because nobody knows what will happen in the future. Playing in the stock market is too risky. 

We know that over time, economies tend to grow. As economies grow, the stock markets will also grow.

If we want to minimize gambling and maximize safety, a good choice would simply be to invest in the entire stock 
market and leave that untouched. What this allows us to do is follow whatever the stock market does. 

Over the short term, this might mean we have many ups and downs. Over many years, however, this means we would be increasing in value exactly alongside the stock market.

We mentioned a lot of abstract things, so let us look at a real boat.

_Figure 1.4 - [Google VWRL.](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1AVFC_enUS821US821&sxsrf=ALeKk00QJ9AI8I6n_Wful5lZ3bl4d0Y1zQ%3A1601496363194&ei=K-V0X-azC9aJ1fAP85OL0AE&q=VWRL&oq=VWRL&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIMCCMQJxCdAhBGEPoBMgQIIxAnMgQIIxAnMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECAAQRzoHCCMQJxCdAjoECAAQQzoLCC4QsQMQxwEQowI6BQgAELEDOgUIABCRAjoOCC4QsQMQgwEQxwEQowI6CAgAELEDEIMBUIXwBVi0-AVg7fkFaABwBHgBgAHWBIgB4waSAQcyLjEuNS0xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwim9dju1pHsAhXWRBUIHfPJAhoQ4dUDCA0&uact=5)_

The above is an ETF. It is created by a company called Vanguard. This ETF tracks down all the stock markets in the world, and creates a huge boat which combines all shares in all stock markets in the world. [This](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-all-world-ucits-etf-usd-distributing) contains information about the ETF above.

Here are some of the returns:

![Image](/images/blog/etf/vwrl-returns-long.jpg)

_Figure 1.5 - [VWRL Returns.](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-all-world-ucits-etf-usd-distributing)_

Since its inception in 2012, this investment option returned 128% -- our money would have more than doubled in these 8 years. The "benchmark" in that graph is the actual stock market, and the "NAV" is our boat. We can see how closely the two things are linked. 

Mind you, this is extremely simple to invest in. What you need to do is log in a website like Vanguard, create an account, choose this ETF (VWRL), and keep adding money to it at the end of every month. You could get started in less than an hour.

Nothing else. Then, we wait.

This is not the sexiest investment option. It will not turn us rich overnight. But there is absolute beauty in the simplicity of this idea. And for most people who do not have the time or patience to explore alternative investment options, this could be useful.

Indeed, there are thousands of other investment opportunities. ETF’s might not be the best choice for people who are looking at more short-term returns, or people who are willing to accept more risk. 

For many of us, however, our goals are long-term safety and stability, and ETF’s can be a great option for that. They are very well-diversified because they invest in all stocks. They are easy to access. They are much cheaper compared to other investments because they do not require much maintenance. They can swing up and down in the short-term, but in the long term, they tend to always make decent returns. 

In conclusion:

1.	There is something called an ETF which allows us to replicate exactly what the stock market does, allowing us to create a “boat” which will carry shares in the exact same direction of the stock market. Because of this, like the stock market, we will swing in the short term. But over the long-term, we tend to rise. Whatever happens to the stock market happens to us.
2.	ETF’s are cheap to buy, easy to maintain, low-risk, very diversified, and quite easy to access. There are many companies out there, like Vanguard, who offer ETF’s with great ease. One could open an account with them and begin investing in the same day.
3.	ETF’s will not make us rich overnight. They could take years to make decent returns. And on a given year, they could even lose money. But they are one of the best ways that we have of replicating the stock market, and over time they tend to rise.

## Subtleties

If you are still here, I hope the above helped you even a little. Most importantly, I hope now you have enough to go explore what strategies suit your needs. You do not need to read what follows. These are just things I would like to point out for completeness, but the main ideas are already mentioned above. 

1. Shares are not the only way a firm can raise cash. There is another way, and that is through debt, or, getting a loan. How many shares and how much debt a firm uses depends on many factors. Often, it will be a combination of both, since abusing one can be more expensive.

2. The view of shares above was simplified. In the real world, shares are more than just a means of distributing ownership. They often include voting rights which allow the shareholders to elect the board of directors in a company, which in turn choose who the CEO of the firm is. Some shares do not include voting rights, and instead might just give the shareholder the right to earn dividends. There are all flavors of shares out there. Also, in large corporations like Apple, it is not a requirement that 100% of the profits get returned to the shareholders. All companies keep part of their profit. The other part is what goes back to shareholders as dividends.

3.	When we hear on the news that Amazon has reached a USD$ 2 trillion value, that number is calculated by multiplying all Amazon shares by their prices. As of today, Amazon has around 500 million shares in the market. The price of each of these shares is around USD$ 3,300. The value, or market cap, of Amazon, is 500,000,000 * $3,300, or, USD$ 1.65 trillion. We can calculate the market cap for an entire stock market as well. We just need to sum all of the market caps from the companies inside the market. 

4.	Primary market transactions often take place as IPO’s (Initial Public Offerings). These are not open to individuals. They usually involve the issuing company hiring an investment bank, which will then sell the shares to a select group of corporations. We can only access these shares once these corporations let go of them in the stock market. 

5.	Past performance is not an indication of future performance. This is true for Apple, the entire stock market, or the economy of the US. It could be that we are now on a downward trajectory for many years to come. That is quite unlikely, however. And if we were in a position where the economy was continually shrinking, stock prices might be one of the last of our concerns.

6.	ETFs also have their flaws. One of them is that they are subject to the movements of the market to the dot. If the market goes down substantially, the ETF will also go down substantially. What you get in exchange for this mirroring is a really low payment fee for the ETF, since it is really easy to use it. The creators of the ETF just do whatever the stock market is doing - this is also called passive investing. This contrasts well with mutual funds, or active investors, who have a higher fee, but who can provide more risk-adjusted returns. Mutual fund managers are actively modifying the portfolio to ensure that they are doing the best they can. This is the difference between active investing and passive investing. A mutual fund manager that is knowledgeable about the market might be able to prevent the fund from dropping as low as the market in times of financial turmoil. However, in exchange for this hands-on-deck management, one needs to pay a higher fee, which in the long-term might erode a large chunk of the gains.

7. There are ETFs for so many things in the world. Technology stocks, real estate stocks, green energy stocks, Japanese stocks... the companies that create ETF’s explore virtually all asset classes. There are also ETF's for things outside of stocks, like commodities for example. ETF’s can also include debt (loans). People who usually vouch for ETF’s will usually mix shares with debt ETFs because they complement each other quite nicely in terms of risk/reward. As diversified as equity ETF’s are, they are still subject to downturns in recessions and periods of stock market losses. Cushioning that with debt can be quite useful.
